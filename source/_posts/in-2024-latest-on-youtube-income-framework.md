### **New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will not only benefit creators. By making it easier for creators to earn on the platform, YouTube is becoming more competitive amongst other platforms. These policies will make YouTube dominate the traditional long-form videos, as well as the emerging shirt-form content. More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.

### **Advertisers to Benefit**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.

### **Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels**

The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.

It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators. You will find that many creators who post shorts on their channels have more views than their long views. With the new policies, it means that they can monetize their channels based only on the short’s figures.
