## Part 1\. Discover How to Verify Monetization on a YouTube Channel

### Steps to Check YouTube Channel Monetization on the Channel's Homepage

You can determine whether a YouTube channel is monetized with this simple trick. Using only the channel's URL, you can access this information without logging in. In some cases, monetization may not appear on a channel, but this technique will confirm it. Here's how:

#### Step 1\. Visit the Channel's homepage

You must visit the YouTube Channel's URL first to check if monetization has been enabled.

![channelâ€™s homepage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-check-if-your-youtube-channel-is-monetized-correctly-1.JPG)

* As a result, the pagÐµ's tÐµxt will be highlighted.
* ThÐµ channÐµl is monÐµtizÐµd if "is\_monÐµtization\_ÐµnablÐµd" is truÐµ, and not if it is falsÐµ.
