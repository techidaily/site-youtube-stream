Building a YouTube channel isn't a walk-in-the-park. As a content creator, you go toiling several processes to ensure its success. More so, you are probably building a brand and want people to know about your product or services. What about one easy way to remember the URL and share it with your potential subscribers? Besides sending such links to people, you'll be reminding them to subscribe with just a click. And that's YouTube auto-subscribe link. It is a more effective way than asking or directing to check your YouTube channel. They'll probably not find it easy, maneuvering around numbers of other channels that bear names close to your channel. A visitor will quickly give up. You can save them the crap and engage more effectively.

## How to subscribe to a YouTube channel?

A YouTube auto-subscribe link will be beneficial in many ways. Here are the steps to subscribe to a YouTube channel. You can subscribe from your phone or computer.

#### Using a phone

1. First, open the YouTube app. Look for it on your phone's home screen or search through apps.
2. Then sign in to your "Google" account for you to be able to subscribe to YouTube channels.
3. Next, locate the channel that you want to subscribe to. You can either subscribe from the channel home page or watch the channel video.
4. Tap on the "Subscribe" button. The text on the "Subscribe" button will immediately change to "Subscribed" once you hit the subscribe tab.
5. Finally, hit the "Subscriptions" tab to manage your channel subscriptions. You'll also manage to see other latest updates from your subscription.
6. You can now easily manage your notifications. You now start to receive notifications of other new channels by default. It is possible to modify this by choosing "All," "None," or "Personalized" to determine how to get notifications.

## Bonus: Will YouTube auto-subscribe me to a new channel?

It is not necessarily true that YouTube auto-subscribe will subscribe to a new channel. However, some reasons may contribute to that. You may have realized that YouTube just subscribed you to random channels without asking you. Here are the possible reasons for that.

• Spinoff Channel  
A content creator may decide to come up with a Spinoff channel. In this case, they may automatically subscribe you to their new channel. In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.

• Check your extensions  
One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser's settings and make the "Unsubscribe" option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.

• Someone else can hit the button  
Do you share your computer with other fellows? The chances are that someone hit the "Subscribe" button without your consent. Just unsubscribe and keep watching next time.
