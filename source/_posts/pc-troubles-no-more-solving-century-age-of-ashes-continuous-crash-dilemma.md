## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, the broken or outdated graphics driver is the main culprit behind the After Effects crashing issues.

 If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, or if the graphics driver file is broken or corrupted, you may suffer from the program crashing, stuttering, and even screen flickering issues.

 Graphics card manufacturers like_Nvidia_ ,_AMD_ and_Intel_ keeps updating their graphics drivers. By doing that, they’ll fix bugs in the last version of graphics driver and enhance the graphics card performance. Sometimes, they also provides support for the new features in creative applications. For example:

> _The March NVIDIA Studio Driver provides optimal support for the latest AI-powered features in creative applications including Adobe Camera Raw, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve 17._
>
> <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/results/171724/>

 In other words, the latest graphics driver will unlock the full potential of your graphics card and give you a better experience for creating and gaming.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

### Option 1: Manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 Your graphics card manufacturer keeps updating drivers. To get them , you need to go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

 Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 The Pro version of Driver Easy comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 You need to restart your PC after you finished updating your graphics driver.

 Launch After Effects to see if it would crash or not. Normally, after you updated the graphics driver, the crashing issue will disappear.

 If the latest graphics driver fails to stop the crash, just read on to try the next fix, below.

## Fix 3: Purge memory & disk cache

 After Effect is a demanding (resource intensive) application. It may crash if your computer is running out of memory, or if your hard disk drive is almost full. To get After Effects work again, you can try purging memory and cache. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch After Effects and go to**Edit** \>**Purge** \>**All Memory** &**Disk Cache…** .  
![Purge all memory and disk cache](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Purge-all-memory-and-disk-cache.jpg)
2. Click**OK** to delete all files from your disk cache.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![Purge all memory and disk cache 1](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Purge-all-memory-and-disk-cache-1.jpg)
3. Launch After Effects again to see if it crashes or not. If it still crashes, try the next fix below.

 If After Effects works well after you purged memory and disk cache, it may suggests that currently your computer doesn’t has sufficient RAM or storage for After Effects to run properly and you may need to upgrade the memory or storage to prevent crashes due to insufficient resources in the future.

 The mechanical hard drive may also be the culprit of the crashing issue. As we all know, the mechanical hard drive is prone to damage. Bad sectors may corrupt the files stored on it and cause crashing. If it is the case, you may want to replace the mechanical hard drive to a solid-state drive (SSD).

## Fix 4: Delete the temp folder of After Effects

 When After Effects failed to override its temp folder, it may crash. Some users fixed the After Effects crashing by deleting its temp folder, and if you haven’t tried this fix yet, you should give it a shot. Don’t worry, after you delete its temp folder, After Effect will create a new one. To delete the temp folder of After Effects, follow the steps below:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to invoke File Explorer.
2. Go to`C:Users[Your username]AppDataRoamingAdobe`
3. Look for**the After Effects folder** and delete it.  
![Delete the temp folder of After Effects](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delete-the-temp-folder-of-After-Effects.jpg)
4. Launch After Effects to see if this issue persists.

If After Effects still crashes, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Reinstall codecs and plugins

 Codecs are used to encode and decode your video files in After Effects. When codecs are corrupted or installed incorrectly, it may trigger the After Effects crashing issue. To fix crashing caused by codecs, you should try reinstall or update them.

 Some incompatible plugins would also crash After Effects. Before installing a 3rd party plugin, you need ensure it is 100% compatible with both your version of After Effects and other plugins. If you’ve installed a new plugin recently, try deactivating it to see if it is the crashing culprit. If it doesn’t help, you may need to reinstall After Effects.

## Fix 6: Update / reinstall After Effects

 If none of the fixes above helped you resolve the crashing issue, try updating / reinstalling After Effects. Normally, after updating After Effects to the latest version, or reinstalling it, you’ll fix the crashing issue.

## Conclusion

 Although the causes of After Effects crashing issue are vary from person to person, keeping After Effects, Windows OS and drivers up to date would eliminate most program crashing issues.

 If these common fixes failed to resolve the After Effects crashing issue, you can also try digging into Windows crash logs to analyze and troubleshoot the causes of the crash.
