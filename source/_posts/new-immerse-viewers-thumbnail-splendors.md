## Why Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?

When people are searching for something to watch on YouTube, they'll look at two (2) things:

1. They'll check the title to see how relevant it is to what they're looking for.
2. Two, they'll check the video thumbnail.

Thumbnail helps them determine off the bat if the video is high quality or not. A poor thumbnail will push them away, while a good one will encourage them to click.

## How To Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?

Suppose you have downloaded a high-quality image that will work great as a thumbnail background for your YouTube video. What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.

Choosing the background image from [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora's native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube's suggested thumbnail size.

It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don't have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.

There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok.

You can reap multiple benefits if you're a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms.
