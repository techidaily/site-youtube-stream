## Part 1: When does youtube pay you \[threshold to meet\]

As a YouTuber, do you feel like you're always struggling to reach some "threshold" where YouTube finally starts rewarding your efforts with some financial reward? You came to the right place; here's a list of Youtube minimum criteria to reach the threshold.

### 1\. 1K subscribers

The first requirement to monetize your channel is to increase your subscribers to at least 1000.

### 2\. Follow all the YouTube channel monetization policies

These policies are a collection of documents containing all the policies, guidelines, and terms that apply to the YouTube Partner Program and advertising programs.

### 3\. Availability in your region

It would be best if you were in the listed countries where Youtube Partner Program is available.

### 4\. Strike free channel

Remember to avoid any strikes if you are planning to monetize your channel.

### 5\. 4,000 watch hours

To qualify as a creator with a sustainable audience, you'll need at least 4,000 public watch hours within 12 months in your channel.

### 6\. AdSense account

You'll need to ensure that you have a Google Adsense account set up and ready to go. Without an Adsense account, the video isn't eligible to be monetized.

## Part 2: How Do You Get Paid on YouTube?

We know that making money from YouTube can be challenging but not impossible. We'll help you figure out how to get paid. Whether you want to create your videos and monetize them or you want to take advantage of the huge pool of talent. We'll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:

### Video length

One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.

### Ad Quality

The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what's happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you're looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.

### Number of clicks each ad receives

The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads' revenue potential by increasing the ad's number of clicks. Advertisers use this metric to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns, which is why optimizing the number of clicks your ads get is so important.

### Ad Blockers

And there are two problems with ad blocking. The first is that it cuts off revenue. The second problem is that it reduces user engagement. Ad blocking decreases the amount of time that users spend watching videos. Youtube videos that rely on advertising to generate revenue may decrease their income.

### Bonus: See how much you can get by YouTube Pay Calculator

## Part 4: Alternative ways to earn more money from YouTube

Some people think they can't make money from YouTube...but that's not true. You can make good money from YouTube, even as a newbie. It just takes some persistence and hard work to make that happen. We'll show you some alternative ways to make more money on YouTube.

### Make Good Content Continuously

Making good content that people love to watch repeatedly is a great way to earn more money. The key is improving the content continuously every week, month, or year.

Creating content that is both entertaining and informative helps people to make decisions. An audience can get a lot of information from the video, but if it is not of good quality, it will not have a good impression.

### Bonus: Spice up your videos with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

A powerful video editing software can help you a lot. With an impactful editor software like Filmora, it allows you to add titles, music, and transition effects to give your video more visual appeal.

![total earnings by channel and video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-does-youtube-pay-you-4.jpg)

The current most popular video editing software application on the market is, hands down, Wondershare Filmora. Editing is incredibly easy with Filmora. Even the most inexperienced user can create a compelling, professional-looking video with Filmora in minutes. With Filmora's video creation tools, anyone can easily edit, add effects, change text, and even make voiceovers. Filmora's intuitive interface is a dream for non-experts as well. Some of its unique features include:

### Stock Media

A royalty-free stock media, smart templates, and visual effects plug-ins will help you add more variety to your videos.

### AI Portrait

Remove backgrounds from photographs with great accuracy, plus includes 80+ artificial intelligence portraits and photo editing stickers.

### Green Screen

The green screen doesn't just change your background but creates special effects, too.

### Keyframing

It helps your videos look more energetic with smooth animation.

#### Color Correction

Add or make your own stunning 3D LUTs with color correction.

### Join Affiliate

Affiliate marketing is a relatively easy way to turn YouTube viewers into customers. You can join many successful affiliate programs, but if you're looking for the most money, go for the ones that offer a recurring commission.

### Get Brand sponsorships

If you're wondering if getting brand sponsorships for Youtube is worth the money, the answer is a resounding yes. Sponsorships on Youtube generate tons of views and even more engagement than ads do.

But brands tend to sponsor only content deemed relevant to the brand. So if you want to be a sponsored content creator, you must get to know your audience first and then build out your social media strategy around the products you sell and the messages you want to communicate.

## Hot FAQs on YouTube channel monetization

### 1\. What if I don't meet the program threshold?

While trying to meet the threshold, focus on making content that will stand out from the competition and build your channel.

### 2\. If I meet the threshold, do I automatically get into the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?

No, the Youtube team will review every channel that passes the threshold. You cannot apply to join the YPP if your account has any active Community Guidelines strike. Plus, your channel must follow Youtube policies and guidelines.

### 3\. How much money does 1 million views make?

For every one million views a YouTube video gets, a YouTuber can make upwards of $5000, based on [Forbes's](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/relationships/how-much-do-youtubers-make/#:~:text=their%20videos.%20Using-,Forbes%E2%80%99s,-estimated%20pay%20rate) estimated pay rate of $5\. However, these are estimates, and the amount YouTubers earn from Youtube varies wildly.

## Final Words

This article is a pretty good overview of the "how" of YouTube monetization, though we would also add that it can take a while to build up a following on YouTube if you're starting. You'll want to ensure that you put enough time and effort into your videos.

Your content must be unique so your viewers will want to stick around and engage with you. And lastly, if you're looking to monetize your YouTube channel, focus on building your channel and growing your audience.
