 Anyone spending any time online recently might have come across something they regard as deplorable. YouTube consumes more than half of the internet’s users with its whopping 2 billion active monthly users. For all that might seem good on the humongous video sharing platform some of the most divisive of all human interactions happen on YouTube.

 Now the question arises on how you can safeguard yourself and your family from the bad and inadequate content and **how to block YouTube channels** that create the toxic material.

## **Part 1: How to block YouTube channels on a computer (Mac & Windows)**

However, there is no way for you to prevent the bullies from watching your content you can at least prevent them from damaging your reputation, badmouthing, and inciting your active subscribers.

 The process of blocking YouTube channels on a computer system is fairly simple and will only require a minute if you know the name of the user you want to block. Follow the steps below:

* 1\. Log in to your YouTube account and look out for the account you want to block.
* 2\. When you’re in the account head over to the **About** section. You can find it in the toolbar beneath the channel art or banner.
