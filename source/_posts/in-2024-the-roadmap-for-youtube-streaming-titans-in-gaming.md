Many intro maker programs and websites are available online. The websites are easier to use, and you can create your intros in just a few minutes, but they have some limitations. You cannot do much customization on those templates. However, if you use Filmora X, you have many options and can customize your intro how you want. We recommend you give it a try, and we assure you that you won't regret your decision.
