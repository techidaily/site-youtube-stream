 | ![ canon t7i](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel3.png)      | Best daily DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS T7i The camera you use to record your daily vlogs doesn't have to be the best camera on the market. It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  **PROS** _\- Long battery life_ _\- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values_   **CONS** _\- Can’t record 4K videos_ _\- Viewfinder is tiny_          |

| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png)       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you'll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_ |

| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png)         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera's great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There's a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you'll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                             |

 | ![ canon t7i](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel3.png)      | Best daily DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS T7i The camera you use to record your daily vlogs doesn't have to be the best camera on the market. It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  **PROS** _\- Long battery life_ _\- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values_   **CONS** _\- Can’t record 4K videos_ _\- Viewfinder is tiny_          |

| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png)       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you'll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_ |

| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png)         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera's great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There's a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you'll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                             |

Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                             |

 | ![ canon t7i](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel3.png)      | Best daily DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS T7i The camera you use to record your daily vlogs doesn't have to be the best camera on the market. It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  **PROS** _\- Long battery life_ _\- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values_   **CONS** _\- Can’t record 4K videos_ _\- Viewfinder is tiny_          |

| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png)       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you'll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_ |

| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png)         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera's great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There's a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you'll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                             |
