## **Part 1\. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing**

YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?

![youtube shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG)

Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.

The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down

* Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.
* YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.
* YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.
* From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.

So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.

**CPM (Cost Per Mile):** CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.

**CPC (Cost Per Click):** Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.

**Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:** You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he/she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.

Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.

All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.

Having known how to check YouTube income, if you’re still wondering how your earnings are calculated, here, we’ve discussed all the necessary information you need to know about how YouTube earnings are calculated.

YouTube earnings are calculated based on different factors. From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;

**CPM (Cost Per Mile):** CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.

**CPC (Cost Per Click):** Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.

**Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:** You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he/she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.

Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.

All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.
