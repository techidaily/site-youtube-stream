## The Leading 7 Android Apps to Cut Out Intrusive Ads

Developers make money by including ADS in their applications. They have two alternatives for customers who want to use their apps: either pay for such a lifetime purchase of the app or enjoy the free version that includes ADS. Best ad blocker for android helps eliminate ADS from apps installed on our Android devices.

Many people choose to use the free version since they can't afford to pay for a standard app, while some opt for Mods, but the best method to avoid ADS is to use programs that block them entirely. Although most of the best ad blockers for android applications listed below work on browsers, you may need to root your Android smartphone to utilize some of them.

Let's get started with this article's list of the best ad blocker for android applications, which will help you get rid of the annoying ads you encounter in apps regularly.

Is the downloading of YouTube videos, including ripping audio from YouTube videos, legal? Here, we'll have a brief discussion regarding the legality of downloading and converting YouTube videos.

According to [YouTube's Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=US&template=terms), it is completely illegal to download, convert, or share the video without getting the appropriate permission from the owner.

However, there are some types of videos that are legal to download, and you can extract audio from YouTube videos falling into these categories:

* **Public Domain:** These videos' copyright is either expired or abandoned. So, there is no owner, and the public can use the video for any purpose.
* **Creative Commons:** These videos are owned by the artists, but they have allowed the public to reproduce and share the content.
* **Copyleft:** These videos are granted free rights to change, share, and reproduce as long as the same rights apply to derivative content.
