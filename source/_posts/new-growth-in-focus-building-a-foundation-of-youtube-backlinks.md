## What Are YouTube Backlinks?

Links between other sites to your YouTube videos are referred to as YouTube backlinks. Backlinks are crucial to growing traffic, increasing discovery speed, and improving ranks. Backlinks are almost akin to a site's reputation as they can act as a vote of confidence for the quality of your videos.

The content of a video with more backlinks is seen as more valuable by search engines than those with less, as each backlink adds confidence that the video is worth linking to.

The popularity of the sites linking to a YouTube video also plays a part as they naturally lead to increased traffic coming to sites through backlinks. Search engines often check popular videos for new backlinks leading to the quick discovery of new content.

The quality of backlinks significantly impacts the ranking and visibility of a given video. Search engines consider links from relevant sources as more valuable as people are more likely to click them.

Lastly, placement and formatting of links play a part as a link that stands out is more likely to generate traffic than one that doesn’t.

## Are YouTube Backlinks Important?

Yes. Backlinks are one of the vital aspects of SEO. They are essential to ranking well in Google search results, and they also help you stay ahead of your competition.

Backlinks act as a powerful source to attract your target audience. While getting people to your might be challenging, sending them to your other work is a breeze. You only have to include YouTube backlinks for free to do so. With 65% of people being visual learners, YouTube is a resourceful place for using backlinks.

## How Can I Get YouTube Backlinks for My Videos?

Getting high-quality backlinks can be challenging if you don't know how to do it. The good news is that there are many different methods that you can use to get links that will benefit your YouTube videos; all it takes is a little creativity.

With that in mind, here are some of the safest ways of getting YouTube backlinks for free for your videos.

#### Guest Vlogging

![Build YouTube Backlink with Guest Vlogging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-1.png)

If you have a large social media following or even just a few loyal subscribers on YouTube, consider using that to your advantage. Many bloggers and popular vloggers will allow guest appearances in their videos — as long as they also get something out of it. If you are a vlogger in a specific niche, you could guest vlog for someone well-known in your niche, or anyone with higher ranking videos than yours.

#### Share Your Videos on Social Media

![Share your youtube video on social media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-2.png)

Posting original content on social media sites is also a great way to get high-quality backlinks for free. People will click your links, and this can help you to get more views and subscribers too. Many bloggers and vloggers often post the videos they feature on their social media platforms.

#### Web 2.0 Sites

![get youtube backlink via web 2.0 sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-3.png)

The use of Web 2.0 sites is a great way to get backlinks for your YouTube videos. Web 2.0 sites, such as Squarespace, Blogger, Blog, Weebly, and WordPress allow you to embed your videos. You can post original content on these sites, which will then link back to yours. So this makes them powerful links indeed.

Incorporate such websites into your marketing strategy and then target your keywords correctly to get more user engagement. In turn, both your site and embedded video will rank on the top page of search engines, meaning you will rank for that particular search query.

#### Pinterest Video Pins

![use pinterest video pins to get backlink](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-4.png)

Pinterest video pins are another great option. They are simply a link to your YouTube video placed on the Pinterest site. With over 320 million monthly active users and more than 200 billion pins saved, this is a great way to get YouTube backlinks for free. It also helps you grow your following.

Creating backlinks using Pinterest video pins can help you tell a story about your brand, idea, or project. Video pins attract and grab the attention of your audience using a cover image. What's more? You can create video adverts to advertise on Pinterest.

#### Unlinked Mentions

![unlinked mentiosn for youtube backlinks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-5.png)

The use of unlinked mentions means that whenever someone writes about a YouTube video without linking it back, you provide them with a link yourself; this is a great way to obtain YouTube backlinks for free.

**●** Questions: Is it safe to buy YouTube backlinks?

**●** No, it is not. You should not buy backlinks because it's against Google's Webmaster Guidelines. If you get caught, you will get a Google penalty for trying to cheat the system.

## What is Twitch VOD?

Twitch Video on Demand (VOD) is a recording of previously streamed content. It provides briefings if you missed catching the Twitch live stream. Just watch the VOD from your favorite streamer and be engaged the best way possible. However, VODs don't last forever. They are removed after two weeks of broadcast. But streamers with Partner Status can have their VODs last up to 60 days.

#### \- How to enable Twitch VOD?

VODs are the best form to archive streams that your fans missed. Even though they are not enabled by default, you can manually enable them and not let your fans miss any important event from your channel. They'll find it under the “Videos” tab on any Twitch channel. Follow these steps to enable VOD on your channel.

**Step 1\. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner of Twitch**  
Check in the “Channel & Video” section and locate the “Stream Key & Preferences” menu.

#### \- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD

These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.

##### 1\. How long will Twitch store my VOD

Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.

Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.

##### 2\. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips

Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don't need any additional requirements to use VOD.

Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.

* To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.
* Then scroll down and click on “Content” > “Video Producer.
* Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”
* Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”
* Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.
* Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.

When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.

The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer's channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.

* To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.
* Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.
* Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You'll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip's link to other social media networks.

#### \- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD

These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.

##### 1\. How long will Twitch store my VOD

Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.

Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.

##### 2\. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips

Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don't need any additional requirements to use VOD.

Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.

* To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.
* Then scroll down and click on “Content” > “Video Producer.
* Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”
* Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”
* Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.
* Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.

When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.

The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer's channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.

* To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.
* Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.
* Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You'll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip's link to other social media networks.
