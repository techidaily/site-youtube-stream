Promoting products, offering educational content or in-depth tutorials on virtually any subject through webinars will enable you to reach new audiences and offer your services on a worldwide market. There are thousands of webinar software products and online platforms, but most of them are quite expensive and they require you to have a considerable amount of experience with the process of setting up and recording webinars.

An alternative solution is available if your budget is tight, but you'd still like to produce a great webinar. We are going to take you through all the steps you'll need to take if you'd like to host a webinar for free and help you spread the word about the products and services you're offering.

## Hosting a Webinar for Free

The world's largest video sharing platform also features broadcasting options that enable its users to schedule events and thus host webinars free of charge. Previously known as the Google Hangouts on Air, the YouTube Live feature is fairly simple to set up, but before you start your first webinar you will need to choose a landing page and a chatbox. If you already have a website you can simply copy and paste the embed link and create a landing page for your webinar, or you can use landing pages software products such as [LeadPages](https://www.leadpages.net/) or [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/) if you don't have your own online domain. For setting up chatboxes for your webinars we recommend using [Chatroll](https://chatroll.com/) or [RumbleTalk](https://www.rumbletalk.com/) platforms, although you'll have to pay a fee if you choose to chat with your audience using these computer programs. So here's how you can host your first webinar on YouTube for free.

#### Step 1. Create a YouTube Event

If you don't already have an account on YouTube, you'll have to create one before you can schedule your first live event. After making sure that you are logged in to your YouTube account head over to the Creator Studio, and click on the Live Streaming tab. Select the New Live Event option and proceed to insert the basic information about the event such as the title, date when the event should take place, tags or a short description of the webinar you're planning.

The Advanced Settings tab will enable you the access to options that will allow you to assign the license and the owner of the webinar. You can also choose the language, set the location or select the category of the event.

#### Step 2. Copy the Embed Code and Paste it To Your Webinar's Landing Page

When you adjust all the settings for your upcoming event, you should click on the Share button. This action will grant you access to the video's embed link, so you can just copy it to your website, or to the landing page you've created with the appropriate software.

#### Step 3. Add the Chatbox to The Webinar's Landing Page

Communicating with the audience during the webinar is important, and for that reason, embedding the chatbox link on the webinar's landing page is a crucial step that will allow you to interact with the participants of your webinar. Chatbox platforms for live events such as [Chatroll](https://chatroll.com/) or RumbleTalk offer amazing features, but they cannot be used for free, which means that you'll have to invest a certain amount of money in order to include a chatbox in your webinar.

#### Step 4. Publish the Webinar's Landing Page and Get the URL

Making the event public a week or a few days before it takes place will provide you with enough time to promote it. Include the webinar's landing page URL in the promotional social media posts and make sure to send out invites for your webinar to your friends and colleagues. Email marketing methods can help you get a larger number of attendees, which is the reason why investing time in the promotion of your webinar can prove to be extremely beneficial.

#### Step 5. Start your Webinar

Hit the Go Live Now button, when you are ready to start your first webinar and enjoy sharing your skills and knowledge with your audience. Even though YouTube offers a simple way to host webinars for free, it lacks the advanced options that enable you to use the prerecorded footage, keep track of the webinar's analytics or create virtual whiteboards and polls.

**Overview:** _Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost._

On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.

Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.

#### 2. [Biteable](https://biteable.com/)

**Overview:** _Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free._

Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.

This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.

#### 3. [Tube Arsenal](https://tubearsenal.com/)

**Overview:** _Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10._

Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates/end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors/logo/images. They have template cards with slots for videos/playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.

Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).

#### 4. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Overview:** _Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros._

Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.

One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.

#### 5. [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

**Overview:** _Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text._

Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).

#### 6. [Intro Cave](https://introcave.com/)

**Overview:** _It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave._

As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.

Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.
