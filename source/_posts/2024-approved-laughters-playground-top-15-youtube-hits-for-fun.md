## What is a Youtube Thumbnail?

A youtube thumbnail is a smaller version of the video, a snapshot that you choose as a preview of your video. A Thumbnail is extremely important because it is essentially the outer packaging of your video; its front cover.

Much like the cover of a book, a thumbnail has to be attractive so that it can tempt your potential viewers to stop and watch your video while they are scrolling on youtube.

thumbnails are a significant factor in determining the number of views a Youtuber gets on his videos.

If you don’t create a thumbnail then youtube will generate one by itself which may not be so enticing for viewers. The purpose of the thumbnail is to make your videos stand out among the rest so you need to pay attention to it!

## How to make Youtube Thumbnails on Mac

You can easily create interesting thumbnails for youtube videos using a thumbnail maker like[FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . Here is a step by step guide:

### 1. Preview the video and choose the still snapshot

The first step in creating a thumbnail is to import the final video into the FilmoraX editor on your MacBook.

![import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/3.import-media-files.jpg)

Then, use the thumbnail editor to play your video and choose the snapshot that you want to be appearing as your thumbnail.

You can easily choose the frame from the video or use the preview frame button to view the frames one by one!

### 2. Add text, shape, and image overlays

Once you’ve chosen the frame for the thumbnail, the next step would be to add text to it to catch the attention of the audience. You can also adjust the thumbnail size as per your requirement, however, the ideal size would be 1280x720 pixels with a minimum width of 640 pixels.
