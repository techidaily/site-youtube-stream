Before we get into the full episode, let’s start by understanding the definition of .AVI file.

AVI encodes its audio and video data on codecs like XviD, DivX and MPEG-2\. A codec is a software or hardware used to compress or decompress digital video.

If you have limited storage, avoid AVI files because they are non-compressed and occupy large space. Conversely, AVI format stores high-quality videos since they are less compressed.
