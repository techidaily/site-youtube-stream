Yes. You can buy YouTube dislikes online. You need to purchase dislikes because they are part of engagement on YouTube. If your video has both dislikes and likes, its chances of ranking higher increase significantly. Dislikes make your video appear more realistic to viewers.

Lots of companies offer affordable rates for buying YouTube likes. The exact amount you have to pay depends on the number of YouTube likes you want. You can buy 50 YouTube likes for $4 to 6, depending on the service provider you use. The price of 1000 likes is around $100.

#### Can the Service Provider Take Back their YouTube likes After Selling them to Me?

No. After a service provider has sent out the likes, they don't have a way to take them back. If you notice your YouTube likes are reducing, they could be fake likes. YouTube does not like fake likes, so they take them away if they find them on your videos. That is why you must only buy likes from reliable service providers.

## Conclusion

● People buy YouTube likes because they help build credibility for their videos, generate more likes, and ensure their videos rank higher on YouTube's search results. You can also use Filmora to improve the quality of your videos, get more views, and grow your channel.
