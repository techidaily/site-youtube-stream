The vertical video went to a mainstream media style. Nowadays, it's common for online video, especially on social apps. Mobile video has become the most common way to watch online videos. It makes sense then that vertical is the preferred familiarization for videos. Users don't want to twist their phones to watch a 30-second ad. Knowing [YouTube shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) vertical size is important as well as Facebook vertical video specs.

Social juggernauts like Facebook and YouTube have adopted vertical video size or formats in current years. The newer social apps, like Snapchat and TikTok, use vertical video completely. While most platforms now prefer vertical video, they each have different patterns. Even Instagram vertical video dimensions premiere is different.

Users tinkering in video marketing know it's essential to stay updated on social media video sizes across all platforms. But, we also know that it is time-consuming to dig through each technical specification of each social app. For that purpose, we have covered all network video sizes for each platform.

01 [What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?](#Part 1)

02 [Vertical Video Dimension for Different Social Apps](#Part 2)

03 [Tips: How to Adjust Vertical Videos Size](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?

Videos come in different sizes. However, one principle is standard in creating them, the vertical video aspect ratio (width to height). This refers to how you compare and create the video height to video ratio (how you intend to record and produce your video).

Ideally, it is what you and viewers will see while watching your video. To create a perfect video, any video creator should decide on the relationship between the video height and width.

When creating YouTube vertical video dimensions, the width is usually longer than the height. Most television videos have a standard ratio of 4:3 and 16:9\. However, social media videos are created using a 1:1 and 9:16 ratio.

![social media video dimension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-4.jpg)

A smartphone can shoot vertical videos perfectly, but some media players like cameras require editing and adjusting the sizes to get the correct aspect ratio. Experts won’t have difficulties adjusting horizontally shot videos, but an amateur will. Fortunately, you can avoid taking unprofessional shoots by focusing on the frame’s center to capture your subject wholly without clipping important aspects. While editing Facebook vertical video dimensions and other social apps, the results could vary depending on the editing software. But you can rotate the video within the software to get the correct dimensions lest you get ugly videos full of black backgrounds filling the frame.

Most cameras and video recorders have inbuilt settings that switch to aspect ratio when you start recording. And the good thing is that you can adjust the settings to your desired dimensions in the settings section. If you are shooting a vertical video without a preset aspect ratio, then:

* Shoot gently without switching your camera horizontally, especially if you are capturing a narrow view.
* Avoid fast spans as it appears intense on the camera that could result in blurry animations.
* Focus on what you are capturing, and if need be, zoom in to capture every essential detail.

The importance of applying aspect ratio in videos is to ensure your images and videos have excellent resolution. This way, you have a chance to present (market) your idea professionally.

03 [Tips: How to Adjust Vertical Videos Size](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?

Videos come in different sizes. However, one principle is standard in creating them, the vertical video aspect ratio (width to height). This refers to how you compare and create the video height to video ratio (how you intend to record and produce your video).

Ideally, it is what you and viewers will see while watching your video. To create a perfect video, any video creator should decide on the relationship between the video height and width.

When creating YouTube vertical video dimensions, the width is usually longer than the height. Most television videos have a standard ratio of 4:3 and 16:9\. However, social media videos are created using a 1:1 and 9:16 ratio.

![social media video dimension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-4.jpg)

A smartphone can shoot vertical videos perfectly, but some media players like cameras require editing and adjusting the sizes to get the correct aspect ratio. Experts won’t have difficulties adjusting horizontally shot videos, but an amateur will. Fortunately, you can avoid taking unprofessional shoots by focusing on the frame’s center to capture your subject wholly without clipping important aspects. While editing Facebook vertical video dimensions and other social apps, the results could vary depending on the editing software. But you can rotate the video within the software to get the correct dimensions lest you get ugly videos full of black backgrounds filling the frame.

Most cameras and video recorders have inbuilt settings that switch to aspect ratio when you start recording. And the good thing is that you can adjust the settings to your desired dimensions in the settings section. If you are shooting a vertical video without a preset aspect ratio, then:

* Shoot gently without switching your camera horizontally, especially if you are capturing a narrow view.
* Avoid fast spans as it appears intense on the camera that could result in blurry animations.
* Focus on what you are capturing, and if need be, zoom in to capture every essential detail.

The importance of applying aspect ratio in videos is to ensure your images and videos have excellent resolution. This way, you have a chance to present (market) your idea professionally.

## Part 2 Vertical Video Dimension for Different Social Apps

## Part 1 What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?

Videos come in different sizes. However, one principle is standard in creating them, the vertical video aspect ratio (width to height). This refers to how you compare and create the video height to video ratio (how you intend to record and produce your video).

Ideally, it is what you and viewers will see while watching your video. To create a perfect video, any video creator should decide on the relationship between the video height and width.

When creating YouTube vertical video dimensions, the width is usually longer than the height. Most television videos have a standard ratio of 4:3 and 16:9\. However, social media videos are created using a 1:1 and 9:16 ratio.

A smartphone can shoot vertical videos perfectly, but some media players like cameras require editing and adjusting the sizes to get the correct aspect ratio. Experts won’t have difficulties adjusting horizontally shot videos, but an amateur will. Fortunately, you can avoid taking unprofessional shoots by focusing on the frame’s center to capture your subject wholly without clipping important aspects. While editing Facebook vertical video dimensions and other social apps, the results could vary depending on the editing software. But you can rotate the video within the software to get the correct dimensions lest you get ugly videos full of black backgrounds filling the frame.

Most cameras and video recorders have inbuilt settings that switch to aspect ratio when you start recording. And the good thing is that you can adjust the settings to your desired dimensions in the settings section. If you are shooting a vertical video without a preset aspect ratio, then:

* Shoot gently without switching your camera horizontally, especially if you are capturing a narrow view.
* Avoid fast spans as it appears intense on the camera that could result in blurry animations.
* Focus on what you are capturing, and if need be, zoom in to capture every essential detail.

The importance of applying aspect ratio in videos is to ensure your images and videos have excellent resolution. This way, you have a chance to present (market) your idea professionally.
