Do you like the animated elements in Wondershare Filmora? Do you want to learn how to make your own?

A little while ago, we posted a list of YouTube channels where you could [get free green screen effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). All of these effects consisted of animations on green backgrounds. To use them, you pull the clip into the PIP track of your Filmora project and use the green screen feature to make the background transparent. It’s pretty easy.

In this post, we’re going to kick things up a bit. Here is a list of places where you can get free lessons on creating your own animated video effects.

**Animated Video Effect Courses:**

[Mt. Mograph](#mtmograph)

[Richard Harrington on Lynda](#lynda)

[Bloop Animation](#bloop)

[Video Copilot](#videocopilot)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 ![Video Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-video-effects.png)

 All of these resources will teach Adobe After Effects, or a similar paid software. If you do not have access to Adobe After Effects, you might want to check out our post on [affordable animation software for video creators](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-or-cheap-animation-software-for-video-creators-122.html).

## **[Mt. Mograph](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUSgx9qc%5FNydrOL59xbJIA)**

On this YouTube channel, motion graphics specialist Matt offers free animation tutorials using a variety of programs including Adobe After Effects and Cinema 4D. His lessons are for a range of skill levels, from beginner to advanced. If you are just starting out then Mt.Mograph is a great resource.

## **[Richard Harrington on Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Rich-Harrington/120-1.html)**

Lynda isn’t free, but the 10-day free trial period is definitely long enough for you to watch this two-hour course.

What’s great about this course is that it assumes you have no animation experience, and it walks you through the main thing a lot of YouTubers want to learn animation for – creating an animated logo.

## **[Bloop Animation](https://www.bloopanimation.com/)**

 Most of the video animation courses on this site are paid, but they have a lot of cool free tutorials as well. The focus is more on animating figures/cartoons than video effects, but if you have any interest in animation more generally then this is a great place to start learning. They even have a free ebook you can download which is targeted at beginners.

YouTube comments are enabled by default, and if they aren’t, learning **how to turn on comments on YouTube** is extremely simple. One of the major benefits of having the comments enabled on your YouTube videos is that you get genuine feedback from your audiences.

As a brand, it is imperative to thoroughly read all the comments that your YouTube videos receive. This not only helps you do sentimental analysis; it also enables you to understand what the viewers expect from you, and where should you focus more while recording and editing your footage.

Keeping all these points in mind, the following sections explain **how to enable comments on YouTube** and **how to turn off comments on YouTube**. Here you will also get to know what other types of security and privacy options are there that you can use to filter the comments posted by the disturbing elements.

## Part 1: How to Turn on or Turn off Comments for YouTube Channel

If you don’t want any comments on any of the videos that you publish, you must learn **how to disable comments on the YouTube** channel. The process of doing so is explained below:

#### Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio

Use your favorite web browser to go to YouTube and sign in to your Google account. Click your profile picture from the top-right corner of the webpage, and click **YouTube Studio** from the menu that appears.

![ Find YouTube Studio options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-studio-option.jpg)

#### Step 2: Go to Channel’s Advanced Settings

From the bottom of the left pane, click the **Settings** icon, click **Channel** from the **Settings** box that comes up next, and go to **Advanced settings** from the right window.

#### Step 3: Turn Off Comments

From the **Audience** section in the right pane itself, click to select the **Yes, set this channel as made for kids. I always upload content that’s made for kids** radio button. Click **SAVE** from the bottom-right corner to save the changes in order to turn off comments on all the videos on your YouTube channel.

To turn on comments on **all the videos on your YouTube channel**, you can follow the instructions given below:

#### 1\. Set Channel Videos as Not Made for Kids

Use the method explained above to get to the channel’s **Advanced settings** box. Select the **No, set this channel as not made for kids. I never upload content that’s made for kids** radio button. Click **SAVE** to save the changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ Turn on or off YouTube content commnets settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-on-off-channel-content-comments-settings.jpg)

#### **Additional Info about Comments Options**

The four options that become available when you allow the comments on your YouTube channel along with their meaning are:

* **Allow all comments**

When you choose this option, YouTube allows everyone to post any kind of comment, irrespective of how inappropriate or unacceptable the text is.

* **Hold potentially inappropriate comments for review**

This option allows all the comments from all the users only if YouTube assumes that the text is safe, and doesn’t contain any inappropriate words. In case YouTube detects some objectionable content such as spam or slang, the comment is not published, until you review the text, and approve it manually.

* **Hold all comments for review**

Selecting this option holds all the comments from all the users, and waits for you to review and allow or disallow each of them manually.

* **Disable comments**

When this option is selected, no one can post a comment to the video(s) whatsoever.

## Part 2: Turn on or Turn off Comments for Specific Videos

As you might have noticed, any video that is marked as ‘Made for kids’ doesn’t allow users to post comments. You can exploit this feature to enable or disable commenting on specific YouTube videos as well.

To learn **how to turn on comments on YouTube** for a specific video, you can follow the steps given below:

#### Step 1: Go to the Content Page

Use the method explained earlier to go to **YouTube Studio**, and click **Content** from the navigation bar in the left.

#### Step 2: Go to the Target Video’s Details Page

Hover the mouse over the target video in the right window, and click the **Details** icon.

#### Step 3: Turn on Comments

From under the **Audience** section in the right window of the **Video details** page, select the **No, it’s not made for kids** radio button. Next, click **SHOW MORE**, scroll down to the **Comments and ratings** section, and choose your preferred privacy option from the **Comment visibility** drop-down list. Click **SAVE** from the upper-right area to save the changes.

#### **Additional Info about Comments Options**

The four options that become available when you allow the comments on your YouTube channel along with their meaning are:

* **Allow all comments**

When you choose this option, YouTube allows everyone to post any kind of comment, irrespective of how inappropriate or unacceptable the text is.

* **Hold potentially inappropriate comments for review**

This option allows all the comments from all the users only if YouTube assumes that the text is safe, and doesn’t contain any inappropriate words. In case YouTube detects some objectionable content such as spam or slang, the comment is not published, until you review the text, and approve it manually.

* **Hold all comments for review**

Selecting this option holds all the comments from all the users, and waits for you to review and allow or disallow each of them manually.

* **Disable comments**

When this option is selected, no one can post a comment to the video(s) whatsoever.

## FAQs About YouTube Comments

#### 1\. Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?

There could be several reasons for this. For instance, the video or the entire channel is configured as ‘Made for kids’ by the owner, comments are disabled for the video or the channel by the owner, you are using some inappropriate words in the comment that have been temporarily blocked by YouTube, and the text requires to be reviewed and approved by the owner before it becomes visible, etc.

#### 2\. I want people to comment on my Private video. What should I do?

At the time of this writing, YouTube doesn’t allow anyone to post a comment on any video that has been set as ‘Private’. If your video is configured that way, you must change its nature to ‘Unlisted’, and share its link to the users before they can post a comment.

#### 3\. How can I block certain words and links on the YouTube comments?

You can go to **YouTube Studio** \> **Settings** \> **Community**, and on the **Automated Filters** tab in the right window, add the words to block in the **Blocked words** field. You can add multiple words by separating them with commas. To block the comments with links, check the **Block links** box. Click **SAVE** to save the changes.

#### 4\. If I turn comments off and back on again, will the old comments come back?

Yes. When you turn off the comments, the existing comments disappear. When you turn them back on, all the previous comments reappear, and become visible to the audience.

#### 5\. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?

That depends on the nature of the comments. For instance, if you modify the settings, the changes are reflected on the comments posted on the new videos, and the new comments on your channel homepage. However, there will be no impact on the existing comments on the existing videos, new comments on the existing videos, and the existing comments on your channel’s homepage.

**Conclusion**

It is easy to understand **how to turn on comments on YouTube**. The best thing is, the comments are enabled by default, and if you don’t need them, you can simply disable them by configuring the videos or the entire channel as ‘Made for kids’. If the comments on any video were enabled previously, and are disabled later on, the existing comments automatically disappear. They reappear when the comments on the video are reenabled.
