#### 1. [YouTube Channel Art Templates from Filmora](https://www.filmora.io/youtube-channel-art)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ YouTube Channel Art Banner Templates Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-templates-download.png)

You can find 50 free YouTube banner templates right here on filmora.io. There are 10 different categories including popular channel types like makeup and gaming.

You have two options for every template: PSD and PNG. If you have Photoshop you’ll be able to edit the PSD file and, if you don’t, you can use the PNG as your banner background when you build your channel art in a free online program like Canva.

#### 2. Behance

Behance is a gallery of creative visual works. There is a very large collection of art you could repurpose for your channel art, but some creators on the site have also created graphics specifically to be used as YouTube banners.

Here are some channel art galleries on Behance: [Ej / Vritra](https://www.behance.net/gallery/10819163/Youtube-Background-Art), [Austin Evans](https://www.behance.net/gallery/11697655/Youtube-Channel-Art)

You can download PSD files from Behance and edit them in Photoshop. There isn’t a PNG or JPG option for people who don’t have Photoshop, though.

In order to download the templates you’ll need to hover your cursor over the Photoshop icon, and then click ‘Download Now’ when it appears. You’ll need to make an account before you can download.

#### 3. [YourTube](http://yourtubetheme.com/youtube-channel-art-templates/)

With over 500 templates available, YourTube has the largest selection on this list. They have every style you can think of, from minimalist to video game themed.

The site is run by two web designers who make the money they need to maintain the site from the few premium/paid options available (although the vast majority of templates are free).

Most of the templates are JPG backgrounds which you will need to add your own text to.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates

In this section you’ll find 9 YouTube channel art makers.

#### 1. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

Wondershare PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.

#### 2. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

To edit the templates available through Adobe Spark, just click on the resources in the template and then click on the images/fonts/etc you want to substitute in. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

Everything you do in Spark starts with clicking on an element in the template. You won’t see all of the menus at once, just the ones related to the element you’ve selected (i.e. the background image or the text).

The only downside of Spark is that free downloads include a watermark. The silver lining is that that watermark is small and located in the bottom-right corner, meaning that it won’t show up for viewers watching your channel on either computers or mobile devices.

_**Note:** for some reason when you click ‘Create your YouTube channel art’ it will load a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Click Resize in the side menu to switch to channel art or your exported image won’t be big enough._

#### 3. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

This is a graphics creator that doubles as a banner maker. You’ll need to enter BeFunky’s ‘Designer’ tool in order to find the channel art templates under ‘Social Media Headers’ and ‘YouTube’. There’s actually only 1 free channel art template, but it is a very standard channel art layout which you can customize with your own images.

#### 4. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

Canva is one of the most popular free channel art makers. It is an easy to use, drag and drop, program that will automatically resize images to work in the spaces you drag them to. It has great free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but many are free.

The templates on Canva do tend to include paid resources, but it’s easy enough to swap them out with free resources or your own images.

#### 5. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

Crello offers 10 examples free channel art templates through their blog, and you can even edit the templates right on the site.

Crello is an easy to use visual editor created for social media and marketing, meaning that it was made to be easy for non-designers to jump into. Beyond the free templates and text options, however, most of their stock photos and backgrounds cost $1\. To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.

#### 6. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.

Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

#### 7. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

Another graphics program with free templates for YouTube channel art. Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.

There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

#### 8. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.

Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.

#### 9. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

Visme provides 50 free channel art templates you can edit through their online graphics service. The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.

How did you make your banner? Did you use a channel art template?

## Part 1: Free Channel Art Template Downloads

In this section you’ll find 3 sites where you can download free YouTube banners.

#### 1. [YouTube Channel Art Templates from Filmora](https://www.filmora.io/youtube-channel-art)

![ YouTube Channel Art Banner Templates Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-templates-download.png)

You can find 50 free YouTube banner templates right here on filmora.io. There are 10 different categories including popular channel types like makeup and gaming.

You have two options for every template: PSD and PNG. If you have Photoshop you’ll be able to edit the PSD file and, if you don’t, you can use the PNG as your banner background when you build your channel art in a free online program like Canva.

#### 2. Behance

Behance is a gallery of creative visual works. There is a very large collection of art you could repurpose for your channel art, but some creators on the site have also created graphics specifically to be used as YouTube banners.

Here are some channel art galleries on Behance: [Ej / Vritra](https://www.behance.net/gallery/10819163/Youtube-Background-Art), [Austin Evans](https://www.behance.net/gallery/11697655/Youtube-Channel-Art)

You can download PSD files from Behance and edit them in Photoshop. There isn’t a PNG or JPG option for people who don’t have Photoshop, though.

In order to download the templates you’ll need to hover your cursor over the Photoshop icon, and then click ‘Download Now’ when it appears. You’ll need to make an account before you can download.

#### 3. [YourTube](http://yourtubetheme.com/youtube-channel-art-templates/)

With over 500 templates available, YourTube has the largest selection on this list. They have every style you can think of, from minimalist to video game themed.

The site is run by two web designers who make the money they need to maintain the site from the few premium/paid options available (although the vast majority of templates are free).

Most of the templates are JPG backgrounds which you will need to add your own text to.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates

In this section you’ll find 9 YouTube channel art makers.

#### 1. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

Wondershare PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.

#### 2. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

To edit the templates available through Adobe Spark, just click on the resources in the template and then click on the images/fonts/etc you want to substitute in. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

Everything you do in Spark starts with clicking on an element in the template. You won’t see all of the menus at once, just the ones related to the element you’ve selected (i.e. the background image or the text).

The only downside of Spark is that free downloads include a watermark. The silver lining is that that watermark is small and located in the bottom-right corner, meaning that it won’t show up for viewers watching your channel on either computers or mobile devices.

_**Note:** for some reason when you click ‘Create your YouTube channel art’ it will load a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Click Resize in the side menu to switch to channel art or your exported image won’t be big enough._

#### 3. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

This is a graphics creator that doubles as a banner maker. You’ll need to enter BeFunky’s ‘Designer’ tool in order to find the channel art templates under ‘Social Media Headers’ and ‘YouTube’. There’s actually only 1 free channel art template, but it is a very standard channel art layout which you can customize with your own images.

#### 4. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

Canva is one of the most popular free channel art makers. It is an easy to use, drag and drop, program that will automatically resize images to work in the spaces you drag them to. It has great free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but many are free.

The templates on Canva do tend to include paid resources, but it’s easy enough to swap them out with free resources or your own images.

#### 5. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

Crello offers 10 examples free channel art templates through their blog, and you can even edit the templates right on the site.

Crello is an easy to use visual editor created for social media and marketing, meaning that it was made to be easy for non-designers to jump into. Beyond the free templates and text options, however, most of their stock photos and backgrounds cost $1\. To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.

#### 6. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.

Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

#### 7. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

Another graphics program with free templates for YouTube channel art. Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.

There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

#### 8. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.

Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.

#### 9. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

Visme provides 50 free channel art templates you can edit through their online graphics service. The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.

How did you make your banner? Did you use a channel art template?

Don't worry—we've got you covered!

This course shows you how to launch a profitable YouTube channel and monetize your new channel.

![start vlog and make money](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-1.jpg)

**Background of vlogs on YouTube**

![background of vlogs on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg)

What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017\. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.

**Why vlogs are loved by people**

Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.

But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.

## Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?

So you've started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren't you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let's look at some common reasons why vloggers aren't making any income and figure out how to get around them.

### Who is my target audience?

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921" border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg)

So, let's be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they're not making money because they haven't figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren't making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they're trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.

### What problems am I solving?

![problem solving](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg)

It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren't making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What solutions am I offering? Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?

The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you're addressing the target audience's needs.

## Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel

It's easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.

### Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)

A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you're passionate about and what you're good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you're offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Consistency and patience

Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people's interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube's algorithm.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Content quality

With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it's clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative. YouTube's algorithm favors videos with large numbers of views, so if you're looking to start a profitable vlog YouTube channel, you'll need to add quality, creativity, and useful content for viewers.

## Part 3: Common Methods of Vlogging Income

We've seen so much misinformation about how to make money via vlogging. This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn't. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let's break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.

### YouTube Ads

![youtube advertising](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg)

Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don't let a video with few views make you think you can't make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.

According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser's actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18\. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Brand Sponsorship

![sponsorship](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg)

While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.

Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Affiliate Marketing

![youtube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg)

Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it's through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.

### Patreon

![support on patreon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg)

Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.

### Sell your service or products

With over 1 billion monthly active users, there's an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category. As for services, you could also offer tips on improving your life, starting an online business, or even becoming a successful Youtuber!

### 1\. Is daily vlogging worth it?

Yes, daily vlogs are the perfect way to establish yourself as an online expert if you think of it as a business. With the right strategy, there is no doubt that starting daily vlogs will be worthwhile for your business.

However, many vloggers have found that it isn't easy to stick to the routine. You may start losing quality, and as a result, your daily vlogs performance degrades. This can be a frustrating experience for you, so you must consider this before embarking on a daily vlogging project.

### 2\. What is the best topic for vlogging?

There isn't a specific topic for vlogging. The best topics to cover on any vlog can be the vlogger's most interesting thing of his life, what he loves doing, what makes him feel like making a difference in the community, or what he wants people to remember about the vlog. It all comes down to a person's personality, interests, and preferences.

### 3\. What equipment do I need to start vlogging?

With a tripod, the most basic gear to start vlogging is a camera, microphone, and computer. Vloggers typically use cameras that range from DSLRs (digital single lens reflex) to iPhones.

In addition to the gear needed to get started, there is one more item you'll need to consider to produce quality vlogs. A video editing software that helps you convert your raw footage into eye-catching content, like Wondershare Filmora.

## The Bottom Line

So, in summary, if you want to become a vlogger, you will need to figure out how to find your target audience, connect with them, and keep them interested in you. And you can do all of this through social media, advertising, and email marketing. It might be tough at first, but once you get started, you'll be able to start generating revenue pretty quickly.

Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?

![target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg)

So, let's be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they're not making money because they haven't figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren't making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they're trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.

### What problems am I solving?

![problem solving](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg)

It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren't making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.

### What solutions am I offering? Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?

The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you're addressing the target audience's needs.

## Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel

It's easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.

### Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)

A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you're passionate about and what you're good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you're offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.

### Consistency and patience

Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people's interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube's algorithm.

## Part 3: Common Methods of Vlogging Income

We've seen so much misinformation about how to make money via vlogging. This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn't. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let's break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.

### YouTube Ads

![youtube advertising](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg)

Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don't let a video with few views make you think you can't make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.

According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser's actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18\. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.

### Brand Sponsorship

![sponsorship](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg)

While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.

Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.

### Affiliate Marketing

![youtube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg)

Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it's through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.

### Patreon

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![support on patreon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg)

Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.

### Sell your service or products

![sell products or services](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg)

With over 1 billion monthly active users, there's an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category. As for services, you could also offer tips on improving your life, starting an online business, or even becoming a successful Youtuber!
