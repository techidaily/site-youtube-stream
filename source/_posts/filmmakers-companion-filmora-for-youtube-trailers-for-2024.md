##### Step1 Start with a hook

Your first step will be to find a way to engage your audience so that they will be interested in your channel or content from the very beginning. To do this, follow the below steps and enjoy the next with your audience.

![a good startup of a trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-1.gif)

**For example**

Step1 Ask a **question**.

Step5 Tell a story without finishing it.

The trick here is to get the viewers' attention within 5 seconds, so they're interested in your channel from the beginning. Also, it intrigues them to keep watching.

##### Step2 Tell a little about yourself

Make a short intro, depending on the content and your presence on the screen. Again, developing a friendly relationship between the viewers and yourself is beneficial.

![self-introduction example](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-2.gif)

You can add a quick introduction about yourself and your backstory. It will create a sense of personal attachment to the channel and help you engage better with the audience.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** keep in mind to make a short intro. Please don't spend too much time on it. And remember, it's all about the audience.

##### Step3 Show, not just tell

Showing the audience what the channel is about is essential. Therefore, you need to spend some time selecting your best footage and graphics to showcase and illustrate your content.

One of the easiest ways is to use perfect music. So if you want to know how to select the right song, go and look at our new release,[the power of music](https://youtu.be/DSyxd9ARmsc), where we teach you everything you need to know for this.

##### Step4 Channel values

Here, you should explain to your audience the purpose of your channel and what they can expect from you. At this stage, new potential viewers can get you, whether your goal is to entertain them, teach something specific, or discuss certain topics and how you intend to achieve them.

![an example of a creative trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-3.jpg)

**Determine the style of your video**

You can refer to the most popular style in your area. Then, making the possibilities endless, you name it!

* A **vlogger video,** in which you have to record your daily activities. You can utilize a special occasion or a visit to historical sites or other landscapes of nature.
* A **Gamer video,** in which you will record your reaction to those chilly horror games or maybe competitive gaming where you can cherish your achievements with your audience.
* Introduce new **challenges** through your videos.
* Introduce **voiceovers** over motion captures.
* Storyteller, in which you will tell about fictional and non-fictional moments.

##### Step5 Schedule

Schedules are vital if you want regularly engaging viewers. The audience will be kept track of your activities and be there as soon as you upload your video. Also, new viewers know when to expect new content from you and commit to your goal, so they know your strategy.

##### Step6 Call to action

What is a Video CTA? A CTA is an action you want your target audience to do after watching a trailer. And that is to subscribe to your YouTube channel.

Tips for your CTA in your trailer

* Please keep it simple, and do not overdo it. Make sure to keep the trailer under a minute or at least two minutes.
* There is no need to ask them to follow you on other platforms other than YouTube.
* If you feel these platforms will keep your audience on track, then do so.
* Beginners should refrain from doing it.
* Keep it friendly and give them the option to do so.

All the details have been shared on creating an ideal trailer for your YouTube channel. To make it simple, check out these three takeaways.

* Keep all the information related to your channel in the trailer, and be true to yourself and your content style.
* You do not want to switch from a style so frequently that it will affect your views and subscribers.

![top social media trends 2018](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-social-media-trends-2018.jpg)

In 2017, 90% of all content shared by Internet users is **video**, and this trend will continue in 2018 because all of the most popular social networks are investing in video features because they believe it can help them generate better user engagement. Furthermore, the ephemeral content, the type of content that is available for less than 24 hours, is on the rise, which means that Instagram or Snapchat stories must be considered as a channel for brand promotion in the next year and in years to come.

**Chatbots** represent a significant force on the market since 80% of chatbots can be utilized for providing non-stop services. Some estimations say that up to 30% of all chat conversations on the Internet will be with chatbots as soon as 2018\. Despite the rapid automatization of the Internet, influencers still play a large role in online marketing, and they will continue to do so because they can produce a ten-time rise in conversion rates. Over 90% of people who at one point used influencer marketing think that it is an effective marketing technique that almost certainly provides results.

One force on the market that needs to be reckoned with are **Smartphones**. The amount of time an average internet user spends on social networks from their Smartphone is significantly larger than the amount of time spent on those same networks from a desktop computer. This means that optimizing online content for Smartphones will become even more important in 2018, than it already is.

**Live Streaming Takes the Center Stage**. Some studies have shown that 80% of customers would prefer to watch a live video streamed by a brand than to read a post. To make things even more interesting, it is estimated that by 2020 80% of Internet traffic will be generated by video content and the video streaming market could easily become $70,5 billion industry by 2021 if its growth continues at this pace.

As of today **Generation Z** already has $44 billion of buying power and this number will continue to grow as the time passes. For that reason, brands and companies will have to adjust their offers to meet the demands of this rising force on the market.
