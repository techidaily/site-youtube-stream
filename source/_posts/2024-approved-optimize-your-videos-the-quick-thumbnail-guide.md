## How to make a thumbnail for Youtube using AI Portrait

With time, Filmora brings new and advanced features for its users to equip them with all the necessary tools required for effective and efficient video editing. One of its latest features is AI Portrait. This feature has several uses and benefits. This feature is designed for Gamers, Vlogger, and other related genres to help them make their videos stand out from the crowd and gain more clicks and views. AI Portrait contains several effects that help you make the human element of the video separate from the background and make it more obvious. We can also use the AI Portrait effects to make beautiful and attractive thumbnails for your Youtube. Follow these steps to create a stunning thumbnail for your Youtube videos.

**Step 01:** Open Filmora X. If it is not already installed on your computer, download and install its latest version from [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![ai-portrait-thumbnail-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-portrait-thumbnail-step1.png)

**Step 02:** Make sure that the aspect ratio of your project is 16:9\. To do that, click on a screen-shaped icon below the preview screen and select "Change Project Aspect Ratio."

![ai-portrait-thumbnail-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-portrait-thumbnail-step2.png)

**Step 03:** Change the Aspect Ratio to 16:9 if it is not set to it already. 16:9 aspect ratio is the standard size of Youtube thumbnails that represents the best possible results.

**Step 04:** Choose a background of your choice for your thumbnail. You can choose a background from the sample colors provided by Filmora.

**Step 05:** If you want to use your custom background, you can import it into the Filmora by clicking import or dragging and dropping it in the media section.

**Step 06:** Import your video the same way into the media folder of Filmora and drag it into the timeline and place it above your background.

**Step 07:** Select your footage, go to the Effects tab and click on AI Portraits. It will open up all the effects related to AI Portraits. These AI Portrait features help you separate the human from a background without using a green screen or anything else.

![ai-portrait-thumbnail-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-portrait-thumbnail-step11.png)

**Step 08:** Double click on any of these effects to see how they will look like on your footage.

**Step 09:** To make a thumbnail for your Youtube, we have to remove the background of your footage first. To do that we have to apply Human Segmentation to the footage first. It will separate the human from the footage. Drag and drop the Human Segmentation effect into the footage in the timeline. Once you drop it into the footage, it will ask you to purchase this feature to export the footage. Since we are not trying to export the footage, we are only creating a thumbnail, click on "Try It". Once the background is removed, you can add other effects as well. Drag and drop the "Human Border" into the footage. It creates an outline around the human in your footage.

![ai-portrait-thumbnail-step9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-portrait-thumbnail-step9.png)

**Step 10:** The effect will be applied to the footage. Now the background has been removed from the footage and ready to be used on your custom background. You can adjust the human accordingly where it looks perfect.

**Step 11:** Now it is time to add a title into your thumbnail to highlight what the video is all about. Go to the Titles, and select lower thirds. You can also select any of the titles types which best suits your needs. Drop the title into the timeline above the footage and adjust it accordingly. Now double click on the header to edit and rename it.

![ai-portrait-thumbnail-step11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-portrait-thumbnail-step11.png)

**Step 12:** Once you are satisfied with the final results, click on the Camera icon below the preview screen or press "Ctrl+Alt+S" to take the screenshot.
