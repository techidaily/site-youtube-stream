#### Use closed captions to improve accessibility

* Sign in to YouTube Studio.
* Then select the "Subtitles" option from the left menu.
* Click on the video that you wish to edit.
* Next, click on the "Add Language" button and select your language.
* Go to the "Subtitles" section and select the "Add" button.
* Finally, enter your captions as the video plays. It will enable viewers who find it challenging to understand your video in detail and probably hit the subscribe button.

#### Translate your video descriptions

* First, sign in to YouTube Studio.
* Then go to the left menu and select the "Subtitles" option.
* Choose the video in which you want to add the translations.

* Then select the "Add language" option and choose the language you wish to translate your video into
* Go to "Titles & descriptions" and select the "Add" tab.
* Lastly, enter the translated description and hit the "Publish" button.

* Firstly, sign in to YouTube Studio.
* Then go to the "Videos" page and select a video to use.
* Select the "Editor" tab from the left menu.
* Next, choose the "Add an end screen" option to direct viewers appropriately.

## Bonus: Will YouTube auto-subscribe me to a new channel?

It is not necessarily true that YouTube auto-subscribe will subscribe to a new channel. However, some reasons may contribute to that. You may have realized that YouTube just subscribed you to random channels without asking you. Here are the possible reasons for that.

• Spinoff Channel  
A content creator may decide to come up with a Spinoff channel. In this case, they may automatically subscribe you to their new channel. In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.

• Check your extensions  
One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser's settings and make the "Unsubscribe" option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.

• Someone else can hit the button  
Do you share your computer with other fellows? The chances are that someone hit the "Subscribe" button without your consent. Just unsubscribe and keep watching next time.

## Conclusion

● The internet arena is very competitive. It would be best if you did everything right to drive as many YouTube auto-subscribers as possible to your channel. And creating a YouTube auto-subscribe link is the first step to making things easier for your potential subscribers. We have covered how to create a YouTube subscribe link and shown other tricks to help you keep your viewers locked.
