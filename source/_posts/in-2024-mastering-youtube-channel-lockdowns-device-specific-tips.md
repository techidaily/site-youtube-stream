## **Part 3: Block content on YouTube kids**

 YouTube Kids is the alternative version of YouTube’s video service dedicated and designed for kids. It’s entirely for children with all the content curated for kids’ education, family-friendly videos, and channels surrounding kid’s liking. The interface features colorful large images, and icons with five categories to explore from.

 The app filters all the content allowing only safe content and parental control to watch their children’s online activity. The app prevents commenting and any kind of cyber bullying-related issues. YouTube Kids need to be set up by an adult with singing into the app with their Google credentials. Parents can sign in and block channels or videos they don’t see fit for their children. Let us see how to block YouTube channels on YouTube kids.

* 1\. Open the YouTube Kids app and tap on **I’m a parent** to set up the app.

## Part 2: Ryan Kaji YouTube Earning and Stats

After seeing the notes about **Ryan’s World's yearly income** and other points, you must wonder how it has increased over the years. To simplify, most of his income comes from YouTube in terms of views and ad revenue, like most YouTubers.

Other than that, his subscriber count also accounts for a portion of what the YouTube algorithm calculates for the income evaluation. Currently, the subscriber counts for the Ryan’s World channel sits at 33.3 million, spread across different age demographics.

![ryans world total views and subscriber count](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/ryan-kajis-net-worth-11-year-old-boy-gets-highest-paid-from-youtube-2022-3.jpg)

To calculate **Ryan World net worth in 2020**, the jump from 2022, and how it grew since 2015 overall, the ads play a major role. Typically, YouTubers earn around USD 3-7 for every 1000 views. His videos get around 277.59 million views per month. So, the overall count can extend to USD 1.11 million per month.

If he earns higher, like USD 7 for every 1000 views, his annual average can increase reach around USD 29.98 million instead of the estimated USD 16.66 million.

Moreover, YouTubers earn from other sources besides the ads on their videos, so the overall **Ryan YouTube income** is likely even higher monthly and yearly. These additional sources include affiliate commissions, sponsorships, interviews at other platforms, and product sales/merchandise.
