Nevertheless, some problems might occur when rendering the web pages from the Central Processing Unit to the Graphic Processing Unit. This causes performance problems. You might notice a green or blank screen while you are watching high-quality videos on YouTube.

In such a case, you need to disable hardware acceleration for resolving video playing problems.

● Right-click on the video which is displaying the green screen.

● Choose ‘Setting’ from the menu.

● Now, click to uncheck the option ‘Enable hardware acceleration’.

● Next, close the window to reload the page.

● To watch the video, reopen the website.

If you don’t find the ‘Settings’ option on the right-clicking the green video screen, disable the option of Hardware Acceleration on the web browser.

### 2. Update the Graphics Card Drivers

In case after establishing the hardware acceleration green screen in the YouTube videos to occur, update the graphics card driver. The video playing issue might have been caused due to the old AMD or NVIDIA graphics card.

Here are the steps to update the Graphics Card Drivers:

● Right-click on ‘My Computer’.

● Now, click on ‘Follow Manage’ and then ‘Device Manager’.

● Next, click on the option ‘Display Adapters’.

● Right-click on the graphics driver and then click on ‘Update Driver Software’.

● Choose ‘Search automatically for updated driver software’. The system will detect the graphics card and will find the latest driver. Restart the PC and the system.

Check out what you have to do.
