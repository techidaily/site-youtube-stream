YouTube is more than a video sharing social network; here's how to get paid on YouTube. Having an active YouTube channel with decent monthly views can earn you income through advertising. If your channel is set up properly, Google can place ads over your YouTube videos and you can earn money based on how many people see or click on (depends on the ad) those ads while watching your videos.

## Part 1: The Requirements for YouTube Monetization

Meeting the minimum requirement for YouTube monetization is probably the hardest part of this whole process. About a month ago, you had to have 10,000 lifetime views on your YouTube channel to qualify for monetization. However, earlier this year, Google changed their eligibility requirements and made them even tougher.

As of February 20, 2018, YouTube channels need to have accumulated 4000 hours of ‘watch time’ over the past 12 months and no less than 1000 subscribers to qualify for monetization. If you do not meet these requirements you cannot join the YouTube Partner Program and monetize your YouTube channel.

So, the first step to successful monetization on YouTube is to actually grow your channel. You need to create videos that will attract viewers and engage your audience. You also need to get people to subscribe because this is really what will grow your YouTube channel over time.

## Part 2: How To Enable Monetization for Your YouTube Channel

Here’s the step-by-step process for monetizing your YouTube Channel, for those who are qualified.

1. Log in to your YouTube account.
1. Find your account icon in the top right corner. Click it to find the ‘Creator Studio’ button.
1. Click the ‘Creator Studio’ button.
1. Click the ‘Channel’ option in the left side menu.
1. You’ll see a drop-down menu under ‘Channel’. Click on ‘Status and Features’. This is actually the first option on the menu. It should open by default once you click the ‘Channel’ button.
1. Look through the ‘Status and Features’ page and click the ‘Enable’ button beside monetization.

![ enable youtube monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-youtube-monetization.jpg)

1. Clicking the ‘Enable’ button should lead you to another page where the guidelines for monetization are explained. Take the time to read through the guidelines and understand the dos and don’ts of YouTube monetization.
1. Once you’ve looked through the guidelines, click the ‘Enable my account’ button to proceed. This will lead you to a page where you’ll be prompted to join the YouTube Partner Program.
1. Read through the YouTube Partner Program terms, check the appropriate boxes, and click the ‘accept’ button.
1. You’ll be prompted to link an AdSense account.
1. Connect an existing AdSense account if you have one or create a new one.
1. Once you’re done linking an AdSense account, you’ll be redirected to YouTube. There, select the type of ads you want to run under ‘Monetization Preferences’.
1. Click the submit button and wait to find out if your account is approved for monetization.

According to YouTube, it can take up to a week for a decision to be reached on your application.

YouTube will not review your monetization application until you’ve met their eligibility criteria. Even then, your application may be declined if your videos do not follow the community guidelines (i.e. channels which simply repost content from other channels will not be monetized).

Not all videos can be monetized. While there are legal ways to create videos consisting of imagery and footage belonging to others, be aware that such videos are not always eligible for monetization. YouTube will only monetize videos that you own. So, posting videos which do not belong to you or which include copyrighted content can cause your monetization application to be declined.

## Part 3: Linking Your Bank Account To Your AdSense Account

AdSense offers a variety of payment options including mailed checks and Western Union transfers. However, these options may not be available to you depending on where you’re based. AdSense does make payments through electronic wire transfer (EFT – Electronic funds transfer) to virtually every country in the world, and this is the preferred payment option for most people.

To have your earnings deposited directly into your account through EFT, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.

Here’s a step-by-step guide for linking your bank account to your AdSense account.

1. Log in to AdSense via: [www.google.com/adsense/start](http://www.google.com/adsense/start)
1. Click the ‘Settings’ button in the left panel menu
1. Under ‘Settings’, click ‘Payments’.
1. On the ‘Payments’ page, click ‘Manage payment options’.
1. Click ‘Add payment method’.
1. Next, you’ll be prompted to add your bank account details. In general, you will be asked to provide the following:  
   1. _Name on the account / account holder’s name_  
   2. _Bank account number_  
   3. _Bank name_  
   4. _Bank SWIFT code_  
   5. _Depending on where you are based, additional information may be required._
1. Ensure that the name on your AdSense account matches the name on the bank account you provide. To edit your AdSense name, click the ‘Manage settings’ button also on the Payments page.

## Part 4: Receiving Payments

To get paid by AdSense, you need to reach the $100 threshold. You may wish to set a higher threshold but as a rule, earnings below the $100 will not be processed for payment (you will still receive the money, it will just keep adding up until it gets to $100 and then you’ll be paid).

Also, bear in mind that AdSense follows a monthly payment cycle. This means that a month’s earnings (assuming they meet the threshold requirement) will be paid next month. Usually, direct deposit payments will be processed between the 21st and 26th of every month. That said, it can take up to 10 days for electronic wire payments to be received.

In addition to reaching the payment threshold, be sure that you have no payment hold on your AdSense account. A payment hold can cause your earnings to be withheld even if it has reached the payment threshold.

To avoid a payment hold, be sure to provide the necessary tax information, verify your identity and your address, make sure the bank account linked to your AdSense is verified, and make sure you have not violated any of YouTube’s guidelines and community rules.

**Conclusion**

Depending on your vlogging skills and the nature of your content (some types of videos get more attention than others), it can take a while for you to be eligible for monetization. And even when you’ve successfully monetized your channel, getting enough views to reach the payment threshold can be tough.

Don’t let this discourage you from working towards earning income from your YouTube channel. Just focus on creating a YouTube channel people will want to watch. That's how to get paid on YouTube - be sticking with your channel long enough for it to grow.

   3. _Bank name_  
   4. _Bank SWIFT code_  
   5. _Depending on where you are based, additional information may be required._
1. Ensure that the name on your AdSense account matches the name on the bank account you provide. To edit your AdSense name, click the ‘Manage settings’ button also on the Payments page.

## Part 4: Receiving Payments

To get paid by AdSense, you need to reach the $100 threshold. You may wish to set a higher threshold but as a rule, earnings below the $100 will not be processed for payment (you will still receive the money, it will just keep adding up until it gets to $100 and then you’ll be paid).

Also, bear in mind that AdSense follows a monthly payment cycle. This means that a month’s earnings (assuming they meet the threshold requirement) will be paid next month. Usually, direct deposit payments will be processed between the 21st and 26th of every month. That said, it can take up to 10 days for electronic wire payments to be received.

In addition to reaching the payment threshold, be sure that you have no payment hold on your AdSense account. A payment hold can cause your earnings to be withheld even if it has reached the payment threshold.

To avoid a payment hold, be sure to provide the necessary tax information, verify your identity and your address, make sure the bank account linked to your AdSense is verified, and make sure you have not violated any of YouTube’s guidelines and community rules.

**Conclusion**

Depending on your vlogging skills and the nature of your content (some types of videos get more attention than others), it can take a while for you to be eligible for monetization. And even when you’ve successfully monetized your channel, getting enough views to reach the payment threshold can be tough.

Don’t let this discourage you from working towards earning income from your YouTube channel. Just focus on creating a YouTube channel people will want to watch. That's how to get paid on YouTube - be sticking with your channel long enough for it to grow.

Many people find it challenging to create compelling video advertisements for their brand promotions. While some of the creative tools might be expensive, the easy ones have a steep learning curve, and engaging a professional designer wouldn’t be something you might be ready for. **YouTube Video Builder** is a great solution for any such situation.

With that being said, the following sections talk about what **YouTube Video Builder** is, how is it useful, what advantages does it offer, and how can you create professional video adverts using the tool.

## Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?

YouTube recently came up with an online tool, **YouTube Video Builder**, that, as the name suggests, enables you as an organization to prepare videos for free. These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and/or products online.

However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with **YouTube Video Builder** to prepare a video advertisement:

* **Logo**

You must have a good-quality photo of your [brand logo](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.

* **HD Images**

At the time of this writing, **YouTube Video Builder** only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.

* **Google Chrome Browser**

You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.

* **YouTube Channel**

Because **YouTube Video Builder** will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own [YouTube Channel created](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.

* **Availability of the Tool and Features**

**YouTube Video Builder** is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.

## Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?

As explained earlier, **YouTube Video Builder** is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.

There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.

Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.

## Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?

Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from. You can send your requests to: <https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/>.

Once your request is approved, you can then use the same Google account to sign in to the **YouTube Video Builder** portal, and start preparing your video advertisements. Here, it is important to understand that the Google account that you use to send an access request and prepare the videos must be the same ID that has your active and functional YouTube Channel.

## Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?

Once you have access to the Beta version of **YouTube Video Builder**, you can start creating the video ads for free. You can learn the process of how this can be done by following the simple instructions given below:

#### Step 1: Prepare a Console

After signing in to your **YouTube Video Builder** account, on the main interface, click **Select Layout** from the navigation bar at the right if not already selected, pick a layout that best suits your needs, and click **Use Layout**.

![ YouTube Video Builder ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-layout.jpg)

Next, from the **Color & Logo** section, choose the base (background) and text colors using their corresponding tools from under the **Brand colors** section.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-color-logo.jpg)

After this, insert an image of your brand logo in the block under the **Logos** category.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-insert-brand-logo.jpg)

#### Step 2: Add the Ingredients

When you are on the **Images & Text** section of the navigation bar, pick the high-definition photos from the **Storyboard** at the bottom, and add them to the **Image 1**, **Image 2**, and **Image 3** boxes accordingly.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-insert-images-texts.jpg)

Now, scroll down to the **Text** section, and add the relevant content in the available text input fields. Make sure to add a compelling **Call to action** text to give the viewers a free passage to connect with you.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder with CTA ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-call-to-action-texts.jpg)

#### Step 3: Make Cosmetic Manipulations

From the **Pick a Font** section of the navigation bar, click the **Google Fonts catalog** link to search for a unique font, and once found, type its name in the available field to use that font.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder - change font ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-pickup-video-text-fonts.jpg)

Alternatively, you can leave the default one selected. When on the **Select Music** section, choose your preferred background music from the drop-down list that is present under the section.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder with music ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-music-for-video.jpg)

Finally, click **Create video**, and wait while **YouTube Video Builder** takes you to the **Preview, Save, Share** section, and generates your video.

![ YouTube Video Builder Video create video  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-create-video.jpg)

#### Step 4: Save the Video and Begin Promotion

After the video is generated, play to preview the film. If everything looks good, click **Save video**.

![ YouTube Video Builder Video Preview and Save  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-save-preview-video.jpg)

On the next page, click **Copy** to copy the video link, and share it with your friends, colleagues, and family members for their feedback.

![ YouTube Video Builder Video Copy Link  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-copy-link.jpg)

Next, scroll down to get to the **Create Campaign** section of the navigation bar, and from the left screen, click **Create campaign** to begin a campaign to promote your brand and/or product(s).

![ YouTube Video Builder Video Create Campaign ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-create-campaign.jpg)

#### Part 5: Tips for Making Good Video Ads with YouTube Video Builder

The whole point here is to prepare your video adverts with the least investment and almost no effort. The following few tips would help you achieve this with ease:

* Make sure to gather all the ingredients such as the photos of the products, brand logo, etc. before starting with the video creation process
* Set a layout, font, theme color, and background music that compliments the product(s) you wish to promote
* Remain consistent with the theme color, fonts, etc. throughout the video
* Make sure to include a catchy ‘Call for action’ text in your video ad
* Make as many modifications as you want before publishing the ad on your YouTube Channel. Avoid doing any amendments after the ad has been posted
* Share the link of your video with as many people as you possibly can to make your product(s) and brand visible and popular
* Make sure to use the ad in your campaigns to make people aware of your brand/product(s)

**Conclusion**

The bitter truth is, producing videos, especially for brand promotions requires expert creators, expensive tools, and a good amount of work experience. Although all these can be managed if you have some spare funds, **YouTube Video Builder** helps you create advertising videos of up to 15 seconds with ease and for free. All you need is access to **YouTube Video Builder**, your own YouTube Channel, your brand logo, and high-definition photos of your product(s).

## Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?

YouTube recently came up with an online tool, **YouTube Video Builder**, that, as the name suggests, enables you as an organization to prepare videos for free. These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and/or products online.

However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with **YouTube Video Builder** to prepare a video advertisement:

* **Logo**

You must have a good-quality photo of your [brand logo](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.

* **HD Images**

At the time of this writing, **YouTube Video Builder** only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.

* **Google Chrome Browser**

You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.

* **YouTube Channel**

Because **YouTube Video Builder** will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own [YouTube Channel created](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.

* **Availability of the Tool and Features**

**YouTube Video Builder** is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.

## Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?

As explained earlier, **YouTube Video Builder** is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.

There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.

Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.

## Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?

Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from. You can send your requests to: <https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/>.

Once your request is approved, you can then use the same Google account to sign in to the **YouTube Video Builder** portal, and start preparing your video advertisements. Here, it is important to understand that the Google account that you use to send an access request and prepare the videos must be the same ID that has your active and functional YouTube Channel.

## Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?
