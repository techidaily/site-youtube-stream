## Part 1: Public VS Unlisted VS Private

 Let's figure out some terms before runing into the how-to part.

 **Public Videos**

 These are videos that everyone can view. This is the majority of YouTube videos, and just about every one you’ve ever watched will have been public. You'll want this if you want lots of people to watch your video.

 **Unlisted**

 Unlisted videos are ones that anybody can view so long as they have the link. The video won’t show up on search results or in "related" or "suggested" videos.

 This is a great setting for sharing a video amongst small groups. You might have a rough edit you want to show a few people, or you might have a show reel that you only want certain people to see.

 **Private**

 Completely private videos cannot be watched by anyone who doesn’t have permission. You grant people permission by allowing their Google accounts to access the video. Nobody else can see the video, regardless of whether they have the link.

 It won’t show up on searches, as related or suggested videos, or even when imbedded in other sites. This is the best setting for a video you need to share with only very specific people, if anyone. Below is a comparison table to know more about [privacy settings](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=1).

![youtube privacy setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-privacy-setting.JPG)

## Part 2: How to Change Privacy Settings

 There are two ways to change the privacy settings: firstly, when you upload the video, and secondly through Creator Studio.

**Method 1:**

 When you upload a video to YouTube you'll see on the right hand side an option that says "privacy". This is defaulted to "public", but you can use the drop-down menu on the button to change the setting. This will apply your privacy setting the second the video finishes uploading and processing.

![upload youtube video privacy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-video-privacy.jpg)

**Method 2:**

 To change the privacy setting later, go to Creator Studio, then Video Manager. On the right-hand side you’ll see one of three icons: a world, a chain, and a lock. The world means **"public"**, the chain means **"unlisted"**, and the lock is for **"private"**.

![youtube privacy settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlisted-video.JPG)

 To change the privacy, click the icon. You’ll be taken to the video's info and settings page. Down below where you see the thumbnails you'll see the selected privacy setting. Click this to open a drop down menu, and select your desired privacy level.

## Part 3: Sharing Private Videos

 If a video is set to "private', you'll have the option to share it with specific people. Below where it says "private" on the info and settings page you'll see a button labeled "share". Click this and type in the email addresses of the people you want to be able to watch the video. You’ll also have the option of notifying the people via email that you’ve shared the video with them.

![share youtube privacy video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-private-video.JPG)

## Conclusion

 And that's all there is to it! Changing the privacy setting on YouTube videos is a simple, helpful tool to allow you to control the audience of you work. Enjoy!

The upbeat disco-pop song has elements of bubblegum pop, soul, and funk, and it takes influence from the Seventies music. It features celebratory horns, echoing synths, and snapping handclaps. The song is about feeling joy and appreciation for the small things in life that make it valuable.

#### 3) How You Like That by Blackpink

Blackpink's How You Like That was recorded in two languages (Japanese and Korean. It was released through Interscope Records, YG Plus, and YG Entertainment. It's a club, trap, hip hop, EDM, and pop song. The music video took one day and eight hours to amass 100 million YouTube views, making it one of the fastest 100 million views on YouTube.

#### 4) Boy With Love by BTS and Halsey

Boy with Luv is the lead single for BTS' 6th extended play called Map of the Soul: Persona. Its release date is April 12, 2019, under Big Hit Entertainment. The video garnered 100 million views in one day and 13 hours.

The music video has vibrant visuals, and it starts with the American singer and songwriter Halsey sitting bored behind a booth that sells tickets. The scene then flashes to BTS, clad in different shades of hot pink and delivering their dynamic choreography in front of Persona, a retro movie theater. The cinematic visual then unfolds, setting the septet against kaleidoscopic backdrops, as they dance, rap, and sing.

#### 5) Ice Cream by Blackpink Featuring Selena Gomez

The video is visually-packed with ten set-ups and 13 outfit changes, making it exciting to watch. In the video, the artist appears sitting perched on an ornate throne, and she is adorned in gold jewelry with matching nails. The best part of her outfit is the traditional Thai headdress, which is tiered and anointed with flowers. Lisa ascends to the throne while she's alternately executing excellent, intricate choreography.

#### 7) Permission to Dance by BTS

Permission to Dance was released July 9, 2021, through Sony Music and Big Hit Music as a stand-alone single. It's the group's third English-language single. Mac, Andrews, and Stephen Kirk were in charge of the production.

The music video hit 100 million views in two days and two hours. In the video, the boy band wears cowboy outfits and breaks their dance moves in the Western background. The theme of Permission to Dance looks like the end of the coronavirus pandemic as nations resume their normal activities and declare the worst of this disease seems to be behind them.

#### 8) Life Goes on by BTS

Released through Columbia Records and Big Hit Entertainment on November 20, 2020, Life Goes On is the lead single from BTS' 5th Korean-language studio album Be. It was produced by j-hope, SUGA, Antonia Armato, Chris James, Ruuth, RM, and Pdogg.

The video reached 100 million views on YouTube in 2 days and 3 hours. And this makes it among the fastest 100 million views on YouTube. The band appears to be lounging lazily, playing a video game. One of the members comes, V, with pizza, and they enjoy it together. V then takes the other members for a drive. When they came back, they watched some movies. They later went to a stadium and performed this song without the audience.

#### 9) Kill This Love by Blackpink

Kill This Love was released by YG Entertainment on April 5, 2019, and it was distributed through Interscope Records and YG Plus.

The music video begins with introduction shots of each member of Blackpink; they are in a room surrounded by trumpets. Jennie performs with 2 massive swan set pieces with the sunset behind her. Lisa then struts around a candy shop as she knocks things off shelves and kicks displays. The scene with Jisoo is a stark contrast, as we see the sun against a black setting with her head being above a pool of water. Next, viewers will see a distraught Rosé, as she's driving a sports car fast chasing down her doppelganger.

#### 10) Psy Gentleman

Gentleman, a K-pop song, was released on April 12, 2013\. It serves as the follow-up to Psy's hit single Gangnam Style.
