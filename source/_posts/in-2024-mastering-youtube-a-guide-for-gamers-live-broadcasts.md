_“Is iMovie good for YouTube?”_

The iMovie is not only good for YouTube but various other social media platforms. The thing is, you have to compromise with the quality offered by Apple's video editor iMovie. Well, iMovie is perfect for getting started for beginners. But, the professionals and ones who want a bit high features than basic ones should look elsewhere. Thus, we always recommend alternatives to a particular software for our audience. In this article, there is a mention of Wondershare Filmora to overcome the drawbacks of iMovie.

Without further ado, let’s begin with **how to upload a video from iMovie to YouTube**. We want to lead with the best iMovie export settings, specific troubleshooting issues, and our alternative intro section to overcome iMovie's limitations.

## Part 1: How to Upload a Video from iMovie to YouTube?

iMovie is ideal for making YouTube videos if you are too basic and are not looking for advanced features. Remember that professionalism pays in these platforms and helps you stand better among others. If you're still interested in making introductory videos, here is a step-by-step guide on **uploading a video to YouTube from iMovie** on Mac first and leading with iPhone.

**Step-by-Step Tutorial on how to upload a video from iMovie to YouTube on Mac**

**Step 1: Create a Project**

On the first step, go to iMovie on Mac and click the **Create New** tab below.

**Step 2: Import Media**

Click the **Import Media** button and browse the files on your computer, as shown below.

**Step 3: Edit Clips**

It’s time to edit video footage. Drag your video to the timeline, as shown below.

Then, you can trim and drag the edges of video clips to allow editing.

**Step 4: Add Titles**

You can add titles by clicking the Title tab and further drag the Title's template into the timeline.

**Step 5: Export the Video**

Click the **Export** button as follows after editing is over.

Select **YouTube** to upload your video over the platform directly.

**Step 6: Save**

After selecting the desired platform, click the **Next** tab to proceed with saving the file.

At last, save your video as shown below.

**Step-by-Step Tutorial on how to upload iMovie to YouTube from iPhone**

**Step 1: Share the iMovie Project**

Go to iMovie on your iPhone. Open the iMovie project on your iPhone and tap the Share button to select **YouTube**. Enter the information of **Title**, **Description**, **Size**, **Tags**, **Privacy**, and **Location** (optional).

**Step 2: Upload iMovie Files**

For ease of use, you can upload saved videos in Photo Library on your iPhone. Then, you can upload iMovie videos via the YouTube iOS app. **Sign In** to YouTube and click the **Camera** icon at the top of the Home page. Select your **iPhone** **Photo Library** file and set the video **Title**, **Description**, **Size**, **Tags**, and **Privacy**. Then, hit the **Upload** button to confirm.

## Part 2: The Best iMovie Export Settings for YouTube Videos

As we all know that iMovie consists of a bit long procedure to export projects. Here are some tips on the best iMovie export settings to avoid an unnecessary headache.

1. **Set small resolution:** Small resolution plays a more significant role, especially while uploading. Thus, you can set the smallest resolution in **the Email** tab of the **Export** button.

2\. **Change Export settings in the File tab:** There is a **File** tab under the Export button. Click it and find various settings that you need to change to get the best export settings for YouTube 2021\. Make the **Title** of the video as small as possible. Set the resolution at 1080P than 4K.

However, it isn't going to upgrade the resolution if your video is already in the 1080P definition. Now, the last setting that will crazily offer you the best quality and lots of space-saving. You have to select **Best (ProRes)** in quality settings for this purpose. These settings also take less time to upload to YouTube.

3\. **Compress is not for speed:** Various options you see in **the Compress**tab are not for speed. They are for how you save the video on a desktop. Thus, always choose the **Better Quality** tab than **Faster**.

4. **Do not export directly to YouTube:** iMovie is pretty basic and doesn't offer great settings to upload your video instantly. You may have to make changes to the uploaded video even if you do this as per our step-by-step guide mentioned above.

## Part 3: How to fix the “Failed to Upload to YouTube” Error on iMovie?

The "iMovie to YouTube failed" problem occurs when you directly upload a YouTube video from iMovie. The issue will result if you upload from any third-party uploader. That is why the direct upload doesn't work, especially in iMovie. You can opt to share your video to the desktop first and then drag it to upload to the YouTube platform.

## Part 4: Upload Videos to YouTube with the Best Alternative to iMovie - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
