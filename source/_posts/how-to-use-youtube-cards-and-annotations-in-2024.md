YouTube Annotations and Cards are both tools for linking viewers to your other videos or to off-YouTube webpages. Two of the major differences between them are:

Annotations are not clickable on mobile devices.

You cannot choose the size or positioning of Cards.

This article will teach you about both Cards and Annotations and discuss the best uses for each of them.

**Part 1: Annotations**

Annotations are messages that float overtop of your videos in the YouTube player. Usually, annotations are clickable and take users to other content created by you.

**Section 1: Types of Annotations**

There are five types of YouTube annotations:

**Notes** are colored boxes placed over the top of your videos.

**Speech Bubbles** look like dialogue boxes in a comic strip. They have tails that you can adjust so it looks like one of the people in your video is saying what is written in the annotation.

**Spotlights** have a subtle border and are completely clear inside. Your text only appears when a viewer’s cursor hovers over top of these annotations.

**Labels** are like spotlights except that viewers do not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.

Any of these annotations can be used to link viewers to other videos, or as subscribe links. You can also add a simple **Title** to your video through the Annotations menu.

**Section 2: How to Use Annotations**

\*Note: the above video mentions Pause annotations, which are no longer available.

Here are two of the best uses for annotations:

**Clickable End Cards / Outros**

One of the best ways you can use spotlight annotations is to create clickable end cards for your videos.

When your video finishes playing the YouTube player will display a selection of suggested videos that might direct viewers away from your channel. You can keep more of these viewers watching your content by creating your own ‘suggested videos’ card and putting it at the end of your videos.

Put thumbnails of two or three of your other videos on your end card, or use ‘picture-in-picture’ to actually imbed footage from them. Then, after you upload your video, go in and place clickable spotlight annotations over top of your video thumbnails.

This is one use for annotations that cannot be duplicated with cards.

**Promoting Your Videos**

You should not wait until the end of your video to start linking viewers to other content. Many viewers will click away before they see your end card because your video is not exactly what they were looking for. By placing note or speech bubble annotations occasionally throughout your videos you can catch some of these people before they click off of your channel.

This works especially well if you link to videos on similar subjects to the one you are annotating.

Instead of just linking to another video of yours, try to link to that video on a playlist. Once a viewer is on a playlist your videos will auto-play after each other, which is good for both your view count and watch time.

You can also use the newer YouTube Cards for this, but Annotations might still be a better choice because viewers only need to click once vs. twice for Cards.

Try both and see which performs best for your channel. It might be in your best interest to keep on using both as they target different audiences – Cards are clickable on mobile devices, for example, but Annotations are not.

#### **Part 2: YouTube Cards**

YouTube Cards are newer than annotations and a lot of people believe they will one day replace Annotations. While there are benefits to Cards – like embedding images to represent your links – you cannot choose the shape, size, or placement of them. This means they have limited uses.

When viewers click on a Card they are shown additional information and a thumbnail representing the page they will be taken to if they choose to click again. This extra step could be either help viewers decide to click your links or give them a second chance to decide they would rather not.

**Section 1: When to Use Cards**

A linked Annotation is simply a call to action viewers can click on. A Card is a call to action as well, but instead of taking the viewer directly to where its link leads when it is clicked a Card opens up into a larger version of itself with a thumbnail image.

Crowdfunding pages (Patreon is a great choice for video creators), charity fundraising pages, and merchandise stores are all examples of links that benefit from the format of YouTube Cards.

When you link a viewer to a non-YouTube page you break up their session time, which negatively impacts your watch time and SEO ranking. You want to make sure that the viewers you are directing away from YouTube are the ones most likely to convert after they leave. By ‘convert’ we mean to contribute to your Patreon campaign, donate to the charity you are promoting, or buy some of your merchandise.

Giving viewers more information and a thumbnail through a Card can help ensure the most interested viewers are the ones clicking your links.

## **Part 2:** **How to Find the First Comments You Have Posted on YouTube?**

There are times when you regret what you've commented on in the past or wish to go back and look up your first message on YouTube. However, it is not always possible to recall the channel or video where you left the comment.

So, is there a way or a tool that can make it just a doodle? Certainly yes. Did you know that you can check for any previous comments you've made on YouTube regardless of how old it is?

Everything you have to do now follows the steps below. For the following methods, it is preferable to use a browser rather than the YouTube App.

* Go to the homepage of YouTube. At the top left corner, Click on the three-lined icon. Click on History next. You will be redirected to your account's history section.
* At the right corner, choose History type as 'community.' Below that, click on the 'Comments' option. Finally, a new tab would open with all your YouTube comment history.

By these basic steps, enjoy editing or deleting your comments and replies directly on YouTube!

However, you will have to scroll down a long way before you hit the end to see your first comment posted on YouTube.

## Part 3: How to Find the Latest Comments you have received on YouTube?

You do not get notifications about comments left on your YouTube videos at times. Mostly, it's due to your notification preferences. When you enable comment notifications, you'll be informed of all the latest comments on your videos. And this, in turn, allows you to keep track of your followers and engage with them more easily.

YouTube is a vast platform, and there are quite a few modifications hidden everywhere. To know everything is not always possible. Now that you are here let's see how to locate the most recent comment you've got on YouTube.

**Step 1: Enable Comment Notifications**

* Open the homepage of YouTube, scroll down to 'Settings' and click on it. You will be redirected to the Setting page.
* From the bar in the left corner, select **Notifications** and scroll down and enable 'Activity on my Channel.'

These steps are convenient both for pc as well as a mobile app. Just follow three steps, Setting-Notifications-Activity on your Channel.

**Step 2: Check the Notification Bar**

* Click on the bell icon at the top right corner and there you would receive notifications regarding all the comment activities. Click on the particular notification to go to that comment.

## Bonus: How to Change the Comments View Order?

Did you know you can also customize your comment section as per your need? On the watch page for your video, you can rearrange the order of the comments. You may sort the comments by top comments or by date added. It's just simple steps ahead.

* First of all, you need to sign in to YouTube Studio: <http://studio.youtube.com>,
* From the left bar, select Content, click a video's thumbnail, and click on Show More in video details page.

![  YouTube comment  and rating settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-comment-ratings.jpg)

* Under 'Comments and ratings,' select Sort by, and then choose between "Top" and "Newest."
* Save the changes, and you are done!

**Conclusion**

YouTube comments play a predominant role in handling your business as a YouTuber. It's reasonable to believe that the search algorithm considers comments on your videos to be a significant indicator of their efficiency, and therefore gives them higher rankings for specific searches.

The higher your video content's exposure on the internet, the more you'll be included in YouTube or Google searches.

YouTube Comments Finder helps you keep track of the good and bad comments in your videos and definitely helps improve the SEO of your Channel. Thanks to YouTube's advanced tools and websites like Hadzy, YouTube comment Finder, YT Comment Finder and YouTube First Comment Finder, managing third-party interaction is a lot simpler today.
