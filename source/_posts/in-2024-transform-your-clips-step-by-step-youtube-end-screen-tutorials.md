## Copyright Laws and Screencasting of Online Video Platforms (YouTube)

YouTube is currently the most useful video streaming platform. This platform has a wide range of amazing videos that make it one of the most subscribed platforms in the world today. This is why thousands of people do screen recordings on YouTube every day for various uses. Some of them record content to use in studies, to share with friends, for offline entertainment and other acceptable ways. There are those that record YouTube content, edit and re-upload it in their own accounts.

However, since YouTube is the most streaming platform in the world today, it has set guidelines and strict rules to be followed to make sure that people do not misuse the platform at all. The YouTube content is protected by US copyright law, and it indicates that any form of recording or conversion of this copyrighted content is illegal. Other issues related to video and audio recording come from various copyright laws and intellectual property rights.

## Is Screen Recording YouTube Illegal?

The legality and illegality of recording YouTube content depend on the purpose of recording. It is absolutely legal to record videos for personal purposes such as sharing content with your friends or keeping them for offline enjoyment.

However, if you have been asking is screen recording on YouTube illegal? Yes it is, if your aim is other than the mentioned above. Some people record YouTube videos for malicious purposes such as reuploading them on YouTube or on other platforms to earn money from it. Such acts are illegal and are punishable.

If YouTube detects any illegal upload, it will suspend the subscriber's account. The illegal content is removed from the YouTube platform within 24 hours. It is advisable for all the users to comply with the set policy strictly and do the screen recording in legal ways and allowed purposes. Before recording any content on YouTube, you must ask yourself this question first; is screen recording on YouTube illegal?
