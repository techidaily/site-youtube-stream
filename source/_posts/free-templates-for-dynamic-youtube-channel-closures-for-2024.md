YouTube end screens are a great way to get your viewers who have watched your YouTube video until the end to subscribe to your channel, visit your website, or watch more of your videos.

With high video and audio quality, it can prevent you from any sort of disturbance. If you want to connect with a larger audience during your Google Meet sessions, you can go for live streaming.

This article will address how to conduct **Google Meet live stream** through the platform of YouTube. To learn more, continue reading this guide.

### 1\. Available Google Workspace Edition

For **Google Meet YouTube live**, there are some requirements. The reason is that not every ordinary user of Google Meet can go for YouTube live streaming. To do so, you should buy any of the following pricing plans:

| **Google Workspace Pricing Plan**                      | **Price**                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Enterprise Starter                                     | Approx. $10/User/Month   |
| Enterprise Standard                                    | Approx. $20/User/Month   |
| Enterprise Plus                                        | Approx. $30/User/Month   |
| Education Plus                                         | Approx. $5/Student/Month |
| Teaching and Learning Upgrade                          | Approx. $4/License/Month |
| Workspace Individual Subscriber                        | Approx. $9.9/Month       |
| Google One Subscribers with 2 TB or More Storage Space | Approx. $10/Month        |

**Note:** To know the exact pricing plans of Google Workspace, you have to contact Google Support.

### 2\. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live

To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel's YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:

Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the "Profile" icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the "YouTube Studio" option.

Afterward, tap on the "Request" option and perform the verification steps for enabling live streaming. After 24 hours, you would get approval for live streaming on YouTube. Hence, you would be able to live stream Google Meet meetings through your YouTube channel.

Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.

Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the **Google Meet live stream** on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.
