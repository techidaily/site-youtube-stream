## What is Twitch VOD?

Twitch Video on Demand (VOD) is a recording of previously streamed content. It provides briefings if you missed catching the Twitch live stream. Just watch the VOD from your favorite streamer and be engaged the best way possible. However, VODs don't last forever. They are removed after two weeks of broadcast. But streamers with Partner Status can have their VODs last up to 60 days.

#### \- How to enable Twitch VOD?

VODs are the best form to archive streams that your fans missed. Even though they are not enabled by default, you can manually enable them and not let your fans miss any important event from your channel. They'll find it under the “Videos” tab on any Twitch channel. Follow these steps to enable VOD on your channel.

**Step 1\. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner of Twitch**  
Check in the “Channel & Video” section and locate the “Stream Key & Preferences” menu.

#### \- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD

These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.

##### 1\. How long will Twitch store my VOD

Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.

Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.

##### 2\. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips

Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don't need any additional requirements to use VOD.

Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.

* To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.
* Then scroll down and click on “Content” > “Video Producer.
* Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”
* Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”
* Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.
* Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.

When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.

The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer's channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.

* To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.
* Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.
* Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You'll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip's link to other social media networks.

## What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube

You stand to gain a lot when you upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube.

#### 1) To enlighten your followers

Your followers will see your streams and make the best decisions. Viewers can check out your recordings and other highlights from past streams. It will help them decide whether they like what they see and probably join your live streams.

#### 2) Twitch provides content for you to share and monetize on YouTube

Since Twitch streaming is more popular nowadays, many people throng it for content. It is not wise to rely entirely on Twitch to discover as a Twitch Streamer. Posting to YouTube will make it known within a short time. You would have announced your streams most nobly and kept your followers up to date, attracting new ones as well.

#### 3) To keep your followers engaged even when you are offline

Even though live streaming is important, some viewers may not attend the live sessions due to different time zones or other commitments. In this regard, when uploaded to YouTube, Twitch will give them a chance to watch your content just whenever they log in. They, therefore, have the option to watch a Twitch VOD of the live stream they missed.

These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.

##### 1\. How long will Twitch store my VOD

Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.

Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.

##### 2\. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips

Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don't need any additional requirements to use VOD.

Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.

* To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.
* Then scroll down and click on “Content” > “Video Producer.
* Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”
* Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”
* Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.
* Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.

When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.

The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer's channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.

* To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.
* Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.
* Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You'll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip's link to other social media networks.

## What is Twitch VOD?

Twitch Video on Demand (VOD) is a recording of previously streamed content. It provides briefings if you missed catching the Twitch live stream. Just watch the VOD from your favorite streamer and be engaged the best way possible. However, VODs don't last forever. They are removed after two weeks of broadcast. But streamers with Partner Status can have their VODs last up to 60 days.

#### \- How to enable Twitch VOD?

VODs are the best form to archive streams that your fans missed. Even though they are not enabled by default, you can manually enable them and not let your fans miss any important event from your channel. They'll find it under the “Videos” tab on any Twitch channel. Follow these steps to enable VOD on your channel.

**Step 1\. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner of Twitch**  
Check in the “Channel & Video” section and locate the “Stream Key & Preferences” menu.

**Step 4\. Go to “VOD Settings” and toggle on the “Store Past Broadcast.”**

## Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion

#### 1.Numbers

 The total number of viewers that interact with site like Dailymotion and YouTube is actually one of the important parameter for business because it decides the number of video ads and text that will be placed on site. We all know that YouTube is world’s biggest network for videos and Dailymotion follows it at second number. Statistics reveal that there are so many advantages of YouTube over Dailymotion, especially in terms of total site visitors as YouTube gets billions of visitors per month but this count is limited to 112 million visitors in case of Dailymotion.

#### 2.3D Videos

As YouTube is developed with Beta so it is capable enough to provide impressive 3D viewing experience to viewers but on the other side, Dailymotion lacks behind in this capability.

#### 3.Video Quality

 One more important criterion for comparison between YouTube and Dailymotion is the overall allowed time limit for video uploads.

 Sadly, Dailymotion cannot give you this much freedom about content and naturally here YouTube again stays on advantageous side for users. May be this is the biggest reason behind billions of having visitors on YouTube platform as compared to only 112 million visitors over Dailymotion.

#### 4.Analytics
