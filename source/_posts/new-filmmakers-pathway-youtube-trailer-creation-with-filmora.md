![self-introduction example](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-2.gif)

You can add a quick introduction about yourself and your backstory. It will create a sense of personal attachment to the channel and help you engage better with the audience.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** keep in mind to make a short intro. Please don't spend too much time on it. And remember, it's all about the audience.

##### Step3 Show, not just tell

Showing the audience what the channel is about is essential. Therefore, you need to spend some time selecting your best footage and graphics to showcase and illustrate your content.

One of the easiest ways is to use perfect music. So if you want to know how to select the right song, go and look at our new release,[the power of music](https://youtu.be/DSyxd9ARmsc), where we teach you everything you need to know for this.

##### Step4 Channel values

Here, you should explain to your audience the purpose of your channel and what they can expect from you. At this stage, new potential viewers can get you, whether your goal is to entertain them, teach something specific, or discuss certain topics and how you intend to achieve them.

![an example of a creative trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-3.jpg)

**Determine the style of your video**

You can refer to the most popular style in your area. Then, making the possibilities endless, you name it!

* A **vlogger video,** in which you have to record your daily activities. You can utilize a special occasion or a visit to historical sites or other landscapes of nature.
* A **Gamer video,** in which you will record your reaction to those chilly horror games or maybe competitive gaming where you can cherish your achievements with your audience.
* Introduce new **challenges** through your videos.
* Introduce **voiceovers** over motion captures.
* Storyteller, in which you will tell about fictional and non-fictional moments.

##### Step5 Schedule

Schedules are vital if you want regularly engaging viewers. The audience will be kept track of your activities and be there as soon as you upload your video. Also, new viewers know when to expect new content from you and commit to your goal, so they know your strategy.

##### Step6 Call to action

What is a Video CTA? A CTA is an action you want your target audience to do after watching a trailer. And that is to subscribe to your YouTube channel.

Tips for your CTA in your trailer

* Please keep it simple, and do not overdo it. Make sure to keep the trailer under a minute or at least two minutes.
* There is no need to ask them to follow you on other platforms other than YouTube.
* If you feel these platforms will keep your audience on track, then do so.
* Beginners should refrain from doing it.
* Keep it friendly and give them the option to do so.

**Best Practice To Create an Ideal Trailer for Your YouTube Channel**

All the details have been shared on creating an ideal trailer for your YouTube channel. To make it simple, check out these three takeaways.

* Keep all the information related to your channel in the trailer, and be true to yourself and your content style.
* You do not want to switch from a style so frequently that it will affect your views and subscribers.
* Repetition will kill off the vibe of a good trailer. Do not use recurrent images or clips in your video

The following is a guide to **YouTube collaborations** \- specifically, it's a list of tips for finding and approaching collab partners. Here are videos from 4 YouTubers who have done successful collabs about how they were able to get other creators to work with them.

   2. _[Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers](#offer)_  
   3. _[Create quality content consistently](#qualitycontent)_
2. **[Tips from YouTube Guru Nick Nimmin](#Nimmin)**  
   1. _[Use the personâ€™s name when you contact them](#usename)_  
   2. _[Keep it simple](#simple)_  
   3. _[Have ideas](#ideas)_
3. **[Tips from Freelancer / Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer](#schmittauer)**

   1. _[Donâ€™t approach other YouTubers as a â€˜fanâ€™](#notafan)_

   3. _[Use Twitter](#twitter)_

 Also, check out these tips on **[how to grow your channel using collab videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

## Tips From Tech YouTuber Roberto Blake

**[Roberto Blake](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCovtFObhY9NypXcyHxAS7-Q)** is a YouTuber who does tech reviews and graphic design tutorials in addition to providing great information about being a creative entrepreneur. He has done several collab videos and has a lot of advice about how to find potential partners. Here are 3 of his biggest tips:

#### 1\. Approach people you already have a relationship with

This could mean friends, people you have met at events like VidCon, or people who are subscribed to your channel. It is easier for someone to want to collaborate with you if they feel like they know you.

#### **2\. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers.**

People sub to Roberto for tech advice, for example, so it makes sense for him to collaborate with people who have insights into technology. Collaborations should never be all about bringing in new subs â€“ make your videos for the people who already watch your channel.

#### **3\. Create quality content consistently.**

If you approach somebody about collaborating and they see that you havenâ€™t posted in over a month, or that you donâ€™t have many videos, it might be harder to get them to agree to work with you. The same goes if they watch your videos and donâ€™t think they are at the same quality level as their videos.

## Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin

This is a collab video about collab videos! **[Nick Nimminâ€™s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCei6wyubYC1I1FwZ54LZFiA)** channel is all about YouTube, and Brandonâ€™s channel **[OnePercentBetter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx%5Fiw)** has tons of cool self-development animations. Itâ€™s Brandon giving the tips in this video, and 3 of his best are:

#### **1\. Use the personâ€™s name when you contact them.**

This might seem obvious, but it is an easy mistake to make. If you send someone an email where you donâ€™t use their name (maybe you just say â€˜heyâ€™) it will seem like you arenâ€™t interested in them. Talking about a video of theirs you like can also help show your interest in them as a creator.

#### **2\. Keep it simple.**

When youâ€™re approaching someone for the first time, donâ€™t overwhelm them with a long email. Limit yourself to around two paragraphs.

#### **3\. Have ideas.**

Donâ€™t make your potential partner do the work of pitching ideas to you. Be open to their ideas, but come up with 1 or 2 ideas of your own you can mention when you approach the creator you want to work with. People will be more likely to say â€˜yesâ€™ to a specific idea than to the idea of collaborating in general, if they donâ€™t already know you.

## Tips From Freelancer / Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer

**[Amy Schmittauer](https://www.youtube.com/user/savvysexysocial/featured)** of Savvy Sexy Social does vlogs, lifestyle videos, and provides tips on being a freelancer. After doing several collabs in one week, she posted this video about how collaborations work best and how you should approach people you might want to work with.

#### **1\.** **Networking is important in finding collab partners.**

Be nice to other creators when you meet them, offline or online, and build real relationships. Amy got to collaborate with **[Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee)** (MKBHD) even though she had not met him before because **[Austin Evans](https://www.youtube.com/user/duncan33303)** \- who she had built a friendship with â€“ vouched for her with him. When you are networking, think beyond what the immediate payoff could be.

#### **2\. Donâ€™t stray too far from your other content.**

Aim to make your collab videos similar, content-wise, to the other videos on your channel. That way the new viewers you get from having the guest YouTuber in your video will be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to subscribe to you.

#### **3\. Thank the people you work with in your videos.**

If you appeared in someone elseâ€™s video, you would probably appreciate it if they thanked you for being there, told their viewers to go check out your channel, and provided a link for them to do so. So, when you host someone else in one of your videos, thatâ€™s the kind of treatment you should give them. If you donâ€™t, then the next person you want to collaborate with will see that and probably wonâ€™t want to work with you.

 _Collab advice starts at around 2:10._

## Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva

**[Eva Gutowski](https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeaseva/featured)** (MyLifeAsEva) is a lifestyle, fashion, and DIY YouTuber who has done numerous collaborations and believes in making real friends on YouTube. In the video above she shares some of her experiences and talks about how to come across as a real person when you approach other YouTubers about collaborating.

#### **1\. Donâ€™t approach other YouTubers as a â€˜fanâ€™.**

If you want to be friends and collab partners, talk to other YouTubers as if you are their equal (which you are!). If you want to work with someone itâ€™s probably because you like their videos, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with saying so. Being all â€˜omg, I love you, please subscribe to me too!â€™ isnâ€™t likely to lead to a collab, though.

#### **2\. Ask questions.**

If youâ€™re just trying to break the ice with someone, it is a good idea to as them a question â€“ potentially about YouTube or one of their videos. This will give them something to engage with, and itâ€™s also a good way to let them know youâ€™re a YouTuber too.

#### **3\. Use Twitter.**

Twitter is the best place to make YouTube friends, in Evaâ€™s opinion. Itâ€™s an easy place to casually introduce yourself and ask questions.

 Do you have any of your advice on YouTube collaborations?

This could mean friends, people you have met at events like VidCon, or people who are subscribed to your channel. It is easier for someone to want to collaborate with you if they feel like they know you.

#### **2\. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers.**

People sub to Roberto for tech advice, for example, so it makes sense for him to collaborate with people who have insights into technology. Collaborations should never be all about bringing in new subs â€“ make your videos for the people who already watch your channel.

#### **3\. Create quality content consistently.**

If you approach somebody about collaborating and they see that you havenâ€™t posted in over a month, or that you donâ€™t have many videos, it might be harder to get them to agree to work with you. The same goes if they watch your videos and donâ€™t think they are at the same quality level as their videos.

## Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin

This is a collab video about collab videos! **[Nick Nimminâ€™s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCei6wyubYC1I1FwZ54LZFiA)** channel is all about YouTube, and Brandonâ€™s channel **[OnePercentBetter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx%5Fiw)** has tons of cool self-development animations. Itâ€™s Brandon giving the tips in this video, and 3 of his best are:

#### **1\. Use the personâ€™s name when you contact them.**

This might seem obvious, but it is an easy mistake to make. If you send someone an email where you donâ€™t use their name (maybe you just say â€˜heyâ€™) it will seem like you arenâ€™t interested in them. Talking about a video of theirs you like can also help show your interest in them as a creator.

#### **2\. Keep it simple.**

When youâ€™re approaching someone for the first time, donâ€™t overwhelm them with a long email. Limit yourself to around two paragraphs.

#### **3\. Have ideas.**

Donâ€™t make your potential partner do the work of pitching ideas to you. Be open to their ideas, but come up with 1 or 2 ideas of your own you can mention when you approach the creator you want to work with. People will be more likely to say â€˜yesâ€™ to a specific idea than to the idea of collaborating in general, if they donâ€™t already know you.

## Tips From Freelancer / Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer

**[Amy Schmittauer](https://www.youtube.com/user/savvysexysocial/featured)** of Savvy Sexy Social does vlogs, lifestyle videos, and provides tips on being a freelancer. After doing several collabs in one week, she posted this video about how collaborations work best and how you should approach people you might want to work with.

#### **1\.** **Networking is important in finding collab partners.**

Be nice to other creators when you meet them, offline or online, and build real relationships. Amy got to collaborate with **[Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee)** (MKBHD) even though she had not met him before because **[Austin Evans](https://www.youtube.com/user/duncan33303)** \- who she had built a friendship with â€“ vouched for her with him. When you are networking, think beyond what the immediate payoff could be.

#### **2\. Donâ€™t stray too far from your other content.**

Aim to make your collab videos similar, content-wise, to the other videos on your channel. That way the new viewers you get from having the guest YouTuber in your video will be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to subscribe to you.

#### **3\. Thank the people you work with in your videos.**

If you appeared in someone elseâ€™s video, you would probably appreciate it if they thanked you for being there, told their viewers to go check out your channel, and provided a link for them to do so. So, when you host someone else in one of your videos, thatâ€™s the kind of treatment you should give them. If you donâ€™t, then the next person you want to collaborate with will see that and probably wonâ€™t want to work with you.

## Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva

**[Eva Gutowski](https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeaseva/featured)** (MyLifeAsEva) is a lifestyle, fashion, and DIY YouTuber who has done numerous collaborations and believes in making real friends on YouTube. In the video above she shares some of her experiences and talks about how to come across as a real person when you approach other YouTubers about collaborating.

#### **1\. Donâ€™t approach other YouTubers as a â€˜fanâ€™.**

If you want to be friends and collab partners, talk to other YouTubers as if you are their equal (which you are!). If you want to work with someone itâ€™s probably because you like their videos, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with saying so. Being all â€˜omg, I love you, please subscribe to me too!â€™ isnâ€™t likely to lead to a collab, though.

#### **2\. Ask questions.**

If youâ€™re just trying to break the ice with someone, it is a good idea to as them a question â€“ potentially about YouTube or one of their videos. This will give them something to engage with, and itâ€™s also a good way to let them know youâ€™re a YouTuber too.

#### **3\. Use Twitter.**

Twitter is the best place to make YouTube friends, in Evaâ€™s opinion. Itâ€™s an easy place to casually introduce yourself and ask questions.
