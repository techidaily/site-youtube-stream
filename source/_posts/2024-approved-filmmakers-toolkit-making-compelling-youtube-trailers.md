##### Step1 Start with a hook

Your first step will be to find a way to engage your audience so that they will be interested in your channel or content from the very beginning. To do this, follow the below steps and enjoy the next with your audience.

![a good startup of a trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-1.gif)

**For example**

Step1 Ask a **question**.

Step2 Start with a **problem** and a solution.

Step3 Use a hypothetical situation with the words like "What if."

Step4 Open with an **exciting** **fact**

Step5 Tell a story without finishing it.

The trick here is to get the viewers' attention within 5 seconds, so they're interested in your channel from the beginning. Also, it intrigues them to keep watching.

##### Step2 Tell a little about yourself

Make a short intro, depending on the content and your presence on the screen. Again, developing a friendly relationship between the viewers and yourself is beneficial.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

You can add a quick introduction about yourself and your backstory. It will create a sense of personal attachment to the channel and help you engage better with the audience.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** keep in mind to make a short intro. Please don't spend too much time on it. And remember, it's all about the audience.

##### Step3 Show, not just tell

Showing the audience what the channel is about is essential. Therefore, you need to spend some time selecting your best footage and graphics to showcase and illustrate your content.

One of the easiest ways is to use perfect music. So if you want to know how to select the right song, go and look at our new release,[the power of music](https://youtu.be/DSyxd9ARmsc), where we teach you everything you need to know for this.

##### Step4 Channel values

Here, you should explain to your audience the purpose of your channel and what they can expect from you. At this stage, new potential viewers can get you, whether your goal is to entertain them, teach something specific, or discuss certain topics and how you intend to achieve them.

![an example of a creative trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-3.jpg)

**Determine the style of your video**

You can refer to the most popular style in your area. Then, making the possibilities endless, you name it!

* A **vlogger video,** in which you have to record your daily activities. You can utilize a special occasion or a visit to historical sites or other landscapes of nature.
* A **Gamer video,** in which you will record your reaction to those chilly horror games or maybe competitive gaming where you can cherish your achievements with your audience.
* Introduce new **challenges** through your videos.
* Introduce **voiceovers** over motion captures.
* Storyteller, in which you will tell about fictional and non-fictional moments.

##### Step5 Schedule

Schedules are vital if you want regularly engaging viewers. The audience will be kept track of your activities and be there as soon as you upload your video. Also, new viewers know when to expect new content from you and commit to your goal, so they know your strategy.

![video posts schedules](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-4.jpg)

##### Step6 Call to action

What is a Video CTA? A CTA is an action you want your target audience to do after watching a trailer. And that is to subscribe to your YouTube channel.

Tips for your CTA in your trailer

* Please keep it simple, and do not overdo it. Make sure to keep the trailer under a minute or at least two minutes.
* There is no need to ask them to follow you on other platforms other than YouTube.
* If you feel these platforms will keep your audience on track, then do so.
* Beginners should refrain from doing it.
* Keep it friendly and give them the option to do so.

**Best Practice To Create an Ideal Trailer for Your YouTube Channel**

All the details have been shared on creating an ideal trailer for your YouTube channel. To make it simple, check out these three takeaways.

* Keep all the information related to your channel in the trailer, and be true to yourself and your content style.
* You do not want to switch from a style so frequently that it will affect your views and subscribers.
* Repetition will kill off the vibe of a good trailer. Do not use recurrent images or clips in your video

Alright! Following the steps mentioned above, you will be able to create a good YouTube trailer that will not only attract more subscribers to your channel. It will also allow them to stay hooked on your new and upcoming content. If you know more tips, share them with us.

YouTube rewards creators for channel growth using "Play Buttons," YouTube Subscriber Awards that they mail to creators who have reached certain milestones such as 100,000 subscribers. Due to user demand for more recognition of smaller channels, YouTube also introduced reward levels for channels that are still growing. These lower levels don't come with trophies, but creators who reach them should feel proud.

Here are all of YouTube's levels, from small to big:

## Benefit levels

[1\. Graphite](#graphite)

[2\. Opal](#opal)

[3\. Bronze](#bronze)

## Awards Level

[4\. The Silver Creator Award](#The Silver Creator Award)

[5\. The Gold Creator Award](#The Gold Creator Award)

[6\. The Diamond Creator Award](#The Diamond Creator Award)

## Super High Level

[7\. The Custom Creator Award](#The Custom Creator Award)

[8\. The Red Diamond Creator Award](#The Red Diamond Creator Award)

[![play-btn-awards-free-download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-btn-awards-free-download.png)](https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers?utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fcampaign=get%5Fsubs%5Fevergreen&utm%5Fcontent=blog%202)

## Benefit levels

YouTube won't award the YouTubers of these levels with physical plaque but will offer them alternative benefits.

### **#1: Graphite Level (0-1000 subscribers)**

![play-btn-awards-graphite-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-btn-awards-graphite-level.jpg)

Graphite is the starter level. As soon as you start a YouTube channel, you will already be on this level until you get up to 1K subscribers. During this time, you should focus on learning how YouTube works and perfecting your video production and editing skills. If your YouTube Channel subscriber is over 100, then you will be allowed to custom the URL of your channel. For more information about Custom Channel URL, please read: [How to Find and Change Your YouTube Channel URL – Super Easy! >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### **#2: Opal Level (1000-10K subscribers)**

![play-btn-awards-opal-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/YouTube-Creator-Award.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<span id="1444782">
					<video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"
           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"
           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">
	   <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1444782">
	   <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png" style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain">
	</video>
	<div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1444782%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);">Click here</a></div>
</span>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1444782/14559" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

After you get your first thousand subscribers on your YouTube channel, you will be on the Opal Level. This is one of the three requirements for getting access to the [Partner Program for monetization](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). By this point, you'll have started to develop your own style and build a personal brand. This is the time to start networking with other YouTubers and trying to find collaboration partners.

### **#3: Bronze Level (10K-100K subscribers)**

Getting ten thousand subscribers is a big deal. By this point, you have enough of a following that they could be called a fanbase, and you can start leveraging your platform to make money through AdSense. Once you pass 10K subscribers, it starts to become easier to find brand deals and sponsorships too. YouTube will offer an additional option of Teespring for the monetized channel at this level.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997630/19272" target="_top" id="1997630">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997630" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/>

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997630/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Awards Level

When a verified YouTube channel reaches a specific milestone and is deemed eligible for a creator award, they are awarded a relatively flat trophy in a metal casing with a YouTube play button symbol.

### **#4: The Silver Creator Award (100K-1 million subscribers)**

**![silver creator award](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silver-creator-award.jpg)**

This is the first level that comes with a trophy. YouTubers with a Silver Play Button probably won't be earning enough money from YouTube to support themselves, but they're in a good position to start going after more lucrative brand deals. Creators at this level may be earning enough to invest in some better camera gear. Channels at this level are also eligible to apply for a digital verification badge.

### **#5: The Gold Creator Award (1 million-10 million subscribers)**

**![play-btn-awards-gold-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-award-gold-plaque.jpg)**

_If people mean graphite when they say 'lead,' and alchemists turn lead into gold, then is YouTube really about alchemy?_

At this level, you're making money. When you first reach 1 million, it may still not be enough to live off of, but you're getting close to being able to make YouTube your job (which you will probably be able to do before leaving the Gold Level). Things like your own makeup line or a book deal are not out of the question at this point.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### **#6: The Diamond Creator Award (10 million-50 million subscribers)**

![play-btn-awards-diamond-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-awards-diamond.jpg)

You're a YouTube star. You've made it. You're making enough money that YouTube/projects spawned from your YouTube channel support you completely, and you've probably got a team of helpers. Expect to be going on tours to meet and perform for your fans' live. Also, if you didn't have a book deal before, you almost definitely have one now.

## Super High Level

The awards in these levels are absent from the Creator Awards page. Only a handful of channels achieved these levels.

### **#7: The Custom Creator Award (50 million subscribers)**

**![play-btn-awards-diamond-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pewdiepie-custom-creator-award.jpg)**

For channels whose subscribers are over 50 million, PewDiePie is the first person to ever receive this reward. It was made by the shape of his channel logo, a fist bump. He nicknamed this custom play button the Ruby Play Button. If you manage to reach this level, you are beyond being a star on YouTube and are now a bonafide pop culture phenomenon.

### **#8: The Red Diamond Creator Award (100 million subscribers)**

**![red diamond creator award](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-diamond-creator-award.jpg)**

The play button at this level features a play button triangle with a large dark red crystal. If you are able to obtain the award at this level, monetization should never be for you to worry about. One hundred million subscribers mean that 1.3% of the people on this planet are watching you. You'd be a legend if you made it. As of August 2020, only PewDiePie and T-series have obtained this award.

He nicknamed this custom play button the Ruby Play Button. If you manage to reach this level, you are beyond being a star on YouTube and are now a bonafide pop culture phenomenon.

### **#8: The Red Diamond Creator Award (100 million subscribers)**

**![red diamond creator award](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-diamond-creator-award.jpg)**

The play button at this level features a play button triangle with a large dark red crystal. If you are able to obtain the award at this level, monetization should never be for you to worry about. One hundred million subscribers mean that 1.3% of the people on this planet are watching you. You'd be a legend if you made it. As of August 2020, only PewDiePie and T-series have obtained this award.

YouTube rewards creators for channel growth using "Play Buttons," YouTube Subscriber Awards that they mail to creators who have reached certain milestones such as 100,000 subscribers. Due to user demand for more recognition of smaller channels, YouTube also introduced reward levels for channels that are still growing. These lower levels don't come with trophies, but creators who reach them should feel proud.

Here are all of YouTube's levels, from small to big:

## Benefit levels

[1\. Graphite](#graphite)

[2\. Opal](#opal)

[3\. Bronze](#bronze)

## Awards Level

[4\. The Silver Creator Award](#The Silver Creator Award)

[5\. The Gold Creator Award](#The Gold Creator Award)

[6\. The Diamond Creator Award](#The Diamond Creator Award)

## Super High Level

[7\. The Custom Creator Award](#The Custom Creator Award)

[8\. The Red Diamond Creator Award](#The Red Diamond Creator Award)

[![play-btn-awards-free-download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-btn-awards-free-download.png)](https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers?utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fcampaign=get%5Fsubs%5Fevergreen&utm%5Fcontent=blog%202)

## Benefit levels

YouTube won't award the YouTubers of these levels with physical plaque but will offer them alternative benefits.

### **#1: Graphite Level (0-1000 subscribers)**

![play-btn-awards-graphite-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-btn-awards-graphite-level.jpg)

Graphite is the starter level. As soon as you start a YouTube channel, you will already be on this level until you get up to 1K subscribers. During this time, you should focus on learning how YouTube works and perfecting your video production and editing skills. If your YouTube Channel subscriber is over 100, then you will be allowed to custom the URL of your channel. For more information about Custom Channel URL, please read: [How to Find and Change Your YouTube Channel URL – Super Easy! >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### **#2: Opal Level (1000-10K subscribers)**

![play-btn-awards-opal-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/YouTube-Creator-Award.jpg)

After you get your first thousand subscribers on your YouTube channel, you will be on the Opal Level. This is one of the three requirements for getting access to the [Partner Program for monetization](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). By this point, you'll have started to develop your own style and build a personal brand. This is the time to start networking with other YouTubers and trying to find collaboration partners.

### **#3: Bronze Level (10K-100K subscribers)**

Getting ten thousand subscribers is a big deal. By this point, you have enough of a following that they could be called a fanbase, and you can start leveraging your platform to make money through AdSense. Once you pass 10K subscribers, it starts to become easier to find brand deals and sponsorships too. YouTube will offer an additional option of Teespring for the monetized channel at this level.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Awards Level

When a verified YouTube channel reaches a specific milestone and is deemed eligible for a creator award, they are awarded a relatively flat trophy in a metal casing with a YouTube play button symbol.

### **#4: The Silver Creator Award (100K-1 million subscribers)**

**![silver creator award](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silver-creator-award.jpg)**

This is the first level that comes with a trophy. YouTubers with a Silver Play Button probably won't be earning enough money from YouTube to support themselves, but they're in a good position to start going after more lucrative brand deals. Creators at this level may be earning enough to invest in some better camera gear. Channels at this level are also eligible to apply for a digital verification badge.

### **#5: The Gold Creator Award (1 million-10 million subscribers)**

**![play-btn-awards-gold-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-award-gold-plaque.jpg)**

_If people mean graphite when they say 'lead,' and alchemists turn lead into gold, then is YouTube really about alchemy?_

At this level, you're making money. When you first reach 1 million, it may still not be enough to live off of, but you're getting close to being able to make YouTube your job (which you will probably be able to do before leaving the Gold Level). Things like your own makeup line or a book deal are not out of the question at this point.

### **#6: The Diamond Creator Award (10 million-50 million subscribers)**

![play-btn-awards-diamond-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-awards-diamond.jpg)

You're a YouTube star. You've made it. You're making enough money that YouTube/projects spawned from your YouTube channel support you completely, and you've probably got a team of helpers. Expect to be going on tours to meet and perform for your fans' live. Also, if you didn't have a book deal before, you almost definitely have one now.

## Super High Level

The awards in these levels are absent from the Creator Awards page. Only a handful of channels achieved these levels.

### **#7: The Custom Creator Award (50 million subscribers)**

**![play-btn-awards-diamond-level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pewdiepie-custom-creator-award.jpg)**

For channels whose subscribers are over 50 million, PewDiePie is the first person to ever receive this reward. It was made by the shape of his channel logo, a fist bump. He nicknamed this custom play button the Ruby Play Button. If you manage to reach this level, you are beyond being a star on YouTube and are now a bonafide pop culture phenomenon.

### **#8: The Red Diamond Creator Award (100 million subscribers)**

**![red diamond creator award](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-diamond-creator-award.jpg)**
