The sea in the backdrop was a testament of their beautiful love story unfolding under the golden dawn. And their first dance under the stars touched people’s hearts.

#### 3.Greatest wedding toast of all time

The most beautiful wedding videos often have a different kind of celebration. The groom’s friends raised the wedding toast in very different way adding more highlights to the celebrations. The newlywed couple kept on bursting with laughter with the toast being sung. Well! Those girls wrote the composition and dedicated it to the bride. How adorable that was! Everyone ended up dancing to their hilarious poem at the end.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Playing a video game is a thrilling experience because it makes us feel the joys of winning and the sorrows of losing. But, the main reason why gaming has become so popular is that it offers entertainment unlike any other. The development of broadcasting and screen capturing software has made sharing gaming videos online possible, and in a little over a decade of YouTube's existence, the platform is one of the best sources of gaming videos of all types.

Gaming YouTube channels, such as Jacksepticeye or Vanoss Gaming have millions of subscribers which makes them quite influential. So in this article, we will take a look at some of the top gaming YouTubers and rank them based on their popularity and the number of subscribers their channels have.

His videos cover all genres of popular video games, such as Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty and they often feature him and his friends making jokes about the gameplay. The VanossGaming channel was created in 2011 and it currently has over 9 billion total views. Last year Evan launched the Rynx channel which focuses on music, but it is still far from being as influential as the channel that made Even famous.

#### 2. [Markiplier \[Mark Edward Fischbach\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/markiplierGAME)

Even though Mark Fischbach is one of the top gaming YouTubers, his channel Markiplier also features comedy videos. With 20.5 million subscribers and a net worth of some $12.5 million, Mark is unquestionably one of the most influential gamers and YouTubers in the world today.

#### 3. [Jacksepticeye \[Seán William McLoughlin\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/jacksepticeye)

His CaptainSparklez channel has over 10 million subscribers, while his other YouTube channels Maron Music, Jordan Maron, and CaptainSparklez2 have significantly fewer subscribers. Jordan often produces Minecraft-themed music video parodies, but in recent years he has also been creating original music for these videos. In 2015 he appeared as CaptainSparklez in the TV series Gamer's Guide to Pretty Much Everything and the following year he made an appearance on the Bad Internet TV series.

#### 6. [The Game Theorists \[Matthew Patrick\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/MatthewPatrick13)

Unlike most top gaming YouTubers, Matthew Patrick the man behind this brilliant channel is more focused on education and cultural aspects of video games. As the channel's name suggests videos often feature several hosts that speak about different aspects of games.

Even though Matthew Patrick's approach to gaming videos is somewhat unorthodox, his YouTube channel still has over 10 million subscribers. Since 2009, when the channel was initially created, The Game Theorists hosted a number of separate shows such as The SCIENCE or DeadLock. Some of the episodes of these shows are only available on channels hosted by other YouTubers, and you can find only a few episodes on The Game Theorists channel. Besides being a popular Internet personality, Matthew Patrick is also an accomplished writer, actor, and producer who graduated Summa Cum Laude from Duke University.

#### 7. [Game Grumps \[Ross O'Donovan\]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9CuvdOVfMPvKCiwdGKL3cQ)

Currently, the Game Grumps YouTube channel has 4.5 million subscribers which makes it one of the most influential authorities on gaming.

Most episodes feature two hosts playing a video game, while commenting on the gameplay, stating their opinions, and often talking about unrelated subjects. The web series doesn't cover a particular gaming genre, and most games the hosts play on the show are suggested by fans. The channel features special holiday-themed episodes that cover holiday editions of video games. Also in some episodes, Arin and Dan play the games alone, even though they frequently have guests on the show.

#### 8. [I AM WILDCAT \[Tyler Wine\]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-kOXc3gBwksVfmndSEz7jg)

Since 2011, when this popular gaming channel was created, it has amassed 6.2 million subscribers and over a billion total views. The 26-year old Indiana-based YouTuber named Tyler Wine became popular for his distinctive commentating style which often includes humor and sometimes even cursing.

In the early days of his career as a YouTube commentator, Tyler was mostly producing videos centered around Call of Duty but as he was securing his place among the top gaming YouTubers his videos started featuring Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto, or Garry's Mode. Tyler has been uploading LetsPlay videos since 2012 to his [WILDCATLetPlays](https://www.youtube.com/user/WILDCATLetsPlays/featured) channel that currently has a little over 200.000 subscribers. He uploaded videos to his channels weekly or once every two weeks in the past, but now he uploads videos to YouTube almost every day.

#### 9. [H20Delirious \[Jonathan Smith\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/H2ODelirious)

The man behind the H20Delirious channel has managed to remain anonymous for more than a decade. This LetsPlay gaming channel was created in May 2007 and since then the channel's owner has identified himself as just Jonathon. He even released prank videos in 2015 and 2017 in which he pretended to reveal his true identity.

However, Jonathon is a part of the VanossGaming crew and his H20Delirious channel has over 10 million subscribers which easily places him among the top gaming YouTubers. He creates LetsPlay videos for popular games like Fallout 4, Hitman, Fortnite, or Grand Theft Auto.
