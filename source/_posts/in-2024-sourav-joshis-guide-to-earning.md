![an example of a creative trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-3.jpg)

**Determine the style of your video**

* A **Gamer video,** in which you will record your reaction to those chilly horror games or maybe competitive gaming where you can cherish your achievements with your audience.
* Introduce new **challenges** through your videos.
* Introduce **voiceovers** over motion captures.
* Storyteller, in which you will tell about fictional and non-fictional moments.
