## How to Use YouTube Enhancements

 First of all, you need to locate YouTube Enhancements. As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.

![Locate enhancements features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg )

 Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video.

It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.

![Qucik Fix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg )

 Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.

With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.
