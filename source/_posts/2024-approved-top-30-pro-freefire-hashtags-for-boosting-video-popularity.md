### **What Monetization Review Entails**

Once you submit your application, YouTubeâ€™s automated systems and human reviewers will look at your channel for a while. They will review it to make sure it follows all the platformâ€™s policies and guidelines. As the reviews are in progress, creators are encouraged to back to the Earn section of YouTube Studio regularly. Typically, you will get the results within a month, but this may be affected by several factors:

* Application Volumes
* Resource Limitations
* System Issues
* Channel requiring several reviewers to determine suitability for YPP

Sometimes the first application may not be successful for some reason. In this case, creators are encouraged to continue uploading original content and try again after 30 days. For second or other rejections, you are allowed to try again after 90 days. During this period, make sure that your channel follows YouTube policies and guidelines to increase your chances of being accepted.

### **Choose How to Earn**

The major way of earning money on YouTube is through ads that show in your videos. In the case of Shorts, the ad-sharing revenue involves YouTube sharing the revenue generated from the ads with creators. However, getting accepted to YPP also allows you to start earning with fan funding and Shopping features. This means that creators can earn money directly from their views using these unique features

![youtube monetization features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/unlock-youtube-monetization-with-500-subscribers-7.JPG)

YouTube monetization 500 subscribers update allows you to earn money through monetization features that were not there before. This allows creators to interact more with their viewer while generating income. The main fan funding features include:

1. **Channel Membership**: Offer a membership plan to your viewer through monthly payments in exchange for perks like emojis and badges.
2. **Super Thanks:** Earn revenue from viewers who show extra gratitude for your videos.
3. **Super Stickers and Super Chat:** Allows your fans to buy Super Chats that highlight their messages or add fun animated images in the live chat.
4. **Shopping:** Allows you to connect your official merchandise story to YouTube to showcase your products.

### 2\. [**Split Screen Video Editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

YouTube Shorts are limited to a length of 1 minute only. Since 60 seconds is quite a short time, you may want to showcase your content on multiple screens. The Split Screen Video Editor on Filmora allows you to make a split screen instantly. Choose from the readily available templates and show your audience what you want from multiple perspectives in the same video.

### 3\. [**Motion Tracking**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

With YouTube Shorts, you need to be more creative. Adding objects to your videos makes them fun and engaging. The motion tracking feature on Filmora allows you to track the movement of an object in the video. You can then pin graphics on the object, making the video more exciting. You can also add specific text and align it to an object, allowing your audience to follow through the story.

### 4\. [**Speed Ramping**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The way you present your video means a lot to the audience. No one wants a boring or a really slow-moving video. With the Speed Ramping feature on Filmora, you can adjust the speed of your Shorts with better control of your keyframes. This allows you to create unique cinematic effects that keep the audience wanting more of the content.

## **Conclusion**

The introduction of the YouTube monetization 500 subscribersâ€™ policy update was a special moment for small YouTubers. It meant that the platform was extending its YPP program to more creators, allowing them to earn money from their content. Lowering the monetization requirement gives more people a chance to make money faster. However, it is important to make sure that your videos are offering value to your audience. We recommend using Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos and make sure they stand out from the competition. The better your videos will be, the more views you will get, and the more money you will make.
