While some love to wear makeup, some don’t. Quite a lot of times you would find a meme, making fun of the ones belonging to the prior category. To all of them, we would like to say, **“STOP JUDGING WOMEN!”** It’s a matter of choice and there’s nothing to shy away from. You would be surprised to know that a lot of them are earning their daily bread today by sharing hacks to nail the latest makeup trend. Okay, we agree that it’s not quite the year for experimenting with new looks. But with the gloom all around, a little makeup and a brief selfie session for your Instagram might make you feel good for a change. Also, with so much time, you might make up your mind on perfecting your skills and launch your makeup tutorial channel someday.

No matter what summoned you to this write-up today, find here some of the **best YouTube makeup artists** you must have heard before. Cut short the troubles of filtering through a whole list of them as we have compiled it on your behalf. So, without beating around the bush, let’s proceed.

## How to Prepare Before Making Your First Makeup Video?

We assume all this must have stimulated the hidden desire in you to film your first makeup video. There's nothing to get nervous about when you have expert tips on how to shoot a perfect makeup tutorial:

1. Make sure you sit facing a window from where the sun is shining through so that it provides a soft natural glow to your face.
2. Ensure there's a continuous stream of light, which hardly flickers or distorts. Set up a ring light to mimic the natural light.
3. To justify the colors of your work and make them pop on your skin, surround yourself with LED luminosity attached with reflectors to disperse the rays evenly throughout the room. This shall keep away the shadows from swallowing you.
4. Assure quality audio by upgrading to camera mics or simply switch to a reliable audio software for getting the work done.
5. Edit out the awkward moments from the shoot, add interesting transitions and effects by narrowing down to a reliable video editing software. Filmora can be a wonderful tool to fine-tune your video, add endless effects, remove background noise (if any) and provide you with full 4K support. And the best thing about it is that it's free for beginners!

## How to Prepare Before Making Your First Makeup Video?

We assume all this must have stimulated the hidden desire in you to film your first makeup video. There's nothing to get nervous about when you have expert tips on how to shoot a perfect makeup tutorial:

1. Make sure you sit facing a window from where the sun is shining through so that it provides a soft natural glow to your face.
2. Ensure there's a continuous stream of light, which hardly flickers or distorts. Set up a ring light to mimic the natural light.
3. To justify the colors of your work and make them pop on your skin, surround yourself with LED luminosity attached with reflectors to disperse the rays evenly throughout the room. This shall keep away the shadows from swallowing you.
4. Assure quality audio by upgrading to camera mics or simply switch to a reliable audio software for getting the work done.
5. Edit out the awkward moments from the shoot, add interesting transitions and effects by narrowing down to a reliable video editing software. Filmora can be a wonderful tool to fine-tune your video, add endless effects, remove background noise (if any) and provide you with full 4K support. And the best thing about it is that it's free for beginners!

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** keep in mind to make a short intro. Please don't spend too much time on it. And remember, it's all about the audience.

##### Step3 Show, not just tell

Showing the audience what the channel is about is essential. Therefore, you need to spend some time selecting your best footage and graphics to showcase and illustrate your content.

One of the easiest ways is to use perfect music. So if you want to know how to select the right song, go and look at our new release,[the power of music](https://youtu.be/DSyxd9ARmsc), where we teach you everything you need to know for this.

##### Step4 Channel values

![an example of a creative trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-3.jpg)

**Determine the style of your video**

You can refer to the most popular style in your area. Then, making the possibilities endless, you name it!

* A **vlogger video,** in which you have to record your daily activities. You can utilize a special occasion or a visit to historical sites or other landscapes of nature.
* A **Gamer video,** in which you will record your reaction to those chilly horror games or maybe competitive gaming where you can cherish your achievements with your audience.
* Introduce new **challenges** through your videos.
* Introduce **voiceovers** over motion captures.
* Storyteller, in which you will tell about fictional and non-fictional moments.
