## Part 2: FAQs About Online YouTube Video Trimmer

**Does YouTube have a trimmer?**

Yes, you may cut videos after they've been uploaded to the YouTube site. You may chop off the beginning, middle, or ending of your movie on a computer. It is not necessary to re-upload a video to cut it. The video's URL, view counts, and comments will remain unchanged. This functionality is only accessible for less than 6 hours long videos.

**What is the difference between cut and trim in video editing?**

Cutting is the process of separating pieces of a clip. You can reuse these portions in another video or delete them entirely. On the other hand, trimming is the process of eliminating or expanding the duration of a video clip's front or tail regions in video editing.

## **Conclusion**

Numerous programs will swiftly upload and trim your tiny movies, ideal for folks who make YouTube videos. Then, some tools can handle huge and bulky files and are ideal for file output and video quality. It's a shame that some of these tools need payment to access their additional editing features.

Yes, you may cut videos after they've been uploaded to the YouTube site. You may chop off the beginning, middle, or ending of your movie on a computer. It is not necessary to re-upload a video to cut it. The video's URL, view counts, and comments will remain unchanged. This functionality is only accessible for less than 6 hours long videos.

Cutting is the process of separating pieces of a clip. You can reuse these portions in another video or delete them entirely. On the other hand, trimming is the process of eliminating or expanding the duration of a video clip's front or tail regions in video editing.

## Part 2: FAQs About Online YouTube Video Trimmer

**Does YouTube have a trimmer?**

Yes, you may cut videos after they've been uploaded to the YouTube site. You may chop off the beginning, middle, or ending of your movie on a computer. It is not necessary to re-upload a video to cut it. The video's URL, view counts, and comments will remain unchanged. This functionality is only accessible for less than 6 hours long videos.

**What is the difference between cut and trim in video editing?**

Cutting is the process of separating pieces of a clip. You can reuse these portions in another video or delete them entirely. On the other hand, trimming is the process of eliminating or expanding the duration of a video clip's front or tail regions in video editing.
