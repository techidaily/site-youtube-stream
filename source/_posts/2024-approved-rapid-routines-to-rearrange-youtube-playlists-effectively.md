To download, you will have to follow a URL link in the description box of the YouTube videos. Be careful, though, as a lot of the links lead to free hosting websites with pop-ups that can harm your computer if you are easily fooled by them.

SoapyEdits is a YouTuber with a [channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ-0Oq4zZj8hJkW1aXFzLr-x6WsjuGsW1) offering a whole playlist of PhotoShop PSD file end screen designs.

Another way to get your YouTube end screens for free, of course, is to make them yourself. Canva is a great free online design tool for this.

## Part 2: How To Build Your Outro For Free (Step-by-step Canva Tutorial)

1\. First, you have to sign up with an e-mail address

![create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-1.jpg)

2\. Once logged in, select “use custom dimensions” and plug in “1920” pixels as your width and “1080” pixels as your height (this, of course, may vary depending on the resolution of your video project).

![create-outro-end-screen-with-canva  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-2.jpg)

3\. After clicking “Design!,” a new browser will open with a blank canvas.

4\. Next, do an image search for “YouTube End Screen,” choose an end screen with a layout that you would like to build off of, and save the image onto your computer.

![download-youtube-outro-end-screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-outro-end-screen.jpg)

5\. Upload the image onto your Canva project.

![upload-downloaded-youtube-end-screen-canva ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-downloaded-youtube-end-screen-canva.jpg)

6\. Stretch your image to the ends of your canvas.

![stretch-end-screen-templates-canva ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stretch-end-screen-templates-canva.jpg)

7\. Insert your own shapes, lines, colours, images, and text over the image.

![adjust-end-screen-templates-in-canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-end-screen-templates-in-canva.jpg)

8\. When you’re done, delete the original image so that you’re left with just your own design. Go ahead and click “download.”
