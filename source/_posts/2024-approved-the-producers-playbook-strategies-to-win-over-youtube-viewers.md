 We have mentioned before about [the equipment you should have to start your YouTube video shooting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), however, being methodical in your approach to the video making process and knowing exactly what and where you are going to stage and record will increase the quality of the content. Focus on the technical aspects of your YouTube video before you actually start shooting and strive to be well prepared for all the challenges a day on the set may bring.

 These and other useful tips may help you make better videos for your YouTube channel, so let's explore different ways of improving your video making skills.

## 10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos

 All videographers agree that you shouldn't come to the set unprepared. Everything has to be in its place, no matter how insignificant it may seem, because a tiny detail can completely ruin the shot or even an entire day of work. These tips are going to help you avoid common mistakes, inexperienced video producers often make.

#### 1. Write the Script

 Everything starts with a script, at least in the cinematography world. You don't have to write long, detailed descriptions of all scenes, just make a short note of every scene, what is being said in the shot, on-screen actions, camera positions, and so on. By doing this, you'll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set. Besides, knowing what you are going to say throughout the video so you don't have to improvise all the time is going to help you feel more relaxed in front of a camera.

#### 2. Build the Set (Lighting included)

 Don't leave anything to chance. You should control everything that is going to be in the shot, so avoid working at locations you can't at least partially control. Shooting in studio-like conditions will enable you to carefully select the scenography and to design light so it matches the scene perfectly. The actors must always be clearly visible to the audience, which is why you need to pay attention to where they are located in the shot and how much light you have in that part of the shot.

#### 3. Keep Your Batteries Charged

 There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at the set anxious to start shooting just to find out that the batteries are empty. Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning. Always have several spare batteries with you, so even if one battery is empty you have the replacement ready. You can also prolong the battery life by switching the camera off when you are not recording.

#### 4. Do a Microphone Check

 Capturing audio with an external microphone drastically increases the quality of the sound in your videos. That's why making absolutely sure that all cables are connected and that the microphone is perfectly placed is paramount if you want to get the sound right. The host or the hosts of the video must be at the right distance from the microphone, usually, the length of their fist with the thumb and pinky finger extended, but this can vary a few inches to either side.

#### 5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition

 The rule of thirds is a common composition principle used by videographers to create balanced and unified images. The rule suggests that the subjects in a shot should be placed at the intersections of the lines that divide the screen. Most digital cameras have a grid that makes using the rule of thirds quite simple because you can easily see when the subjects in the shot are not positioned correctly.

 This is just one of many shot composition techniques you have at your disposal, and as you gain more experience you'll learn how to combine them and get aesthetically pleasing results.

#### 6. Always Record Videos in Landscape Mode

 Posting vertically oriented videos to your YouTube channel will make you look unprofessional because portrait mode is never used for capturing videos. YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.

 By switching to portrait mode, you'll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.

#### 7. Eliminate The Background Noises

 Professional microphones can pick up even the softest sounds, that might prove difficult to remove in the post-production. You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you're shooting on an outdoor location.

 Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can't hear what the person in the video is saying.

 If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can [remove the background noise]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html ) by using some video editing software.

#### 8. Keep The Shot in Focus

 You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won't be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.

 The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won't have to pull focus that often.

#### 9. Put The Camera on a Tripod

![Camera tripod ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cartoni-omega-professional-tripod-system.jpg)

 The footage you produce should be smooth and free of camera shakes. All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.

 In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.

#### 10. Find The Best Angle

 Every scene has its perfect angle, you just have to find it. This job is much easier if you have already built the set and adjusted the lighting before approaching the shot selection process because it will allow you to know exactly where the camera should be.

 The camera position depends on a number of factors, including the video's aesthetics or the action that takes place in the shot, and you have to go through this process for each shot in your video.

 Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can't hear what the person in the video is saying.

 If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can [remove the background noise]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html ) by using some video editing software.

#### 8. Keep The Shot in Focus

 You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won't be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.

 The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won't have to pull focus that often.

#### 9. Put The Camera on a Tripod

![Camera tripod ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cartoni-omega-professional-tripod-system.jpg)

 The footage you produce should be smooth and free of camera shakes. All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.

 In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.

 We have chosen some of the [best tripods that you can use for starting a YouTube vlogging Video shooting]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/how-to-use-tripod-for-vlogging.html). If you are using a 4K camera, here are some [tripods that you can use for your 4K Cameras]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/4k/best-tripods-for-4k-camera.html).

#### 10. Find The Best Angle

 Every scene has its perfect angle, you just have to find it. This job is much easier if you have already built the set and adjusted the lighting before approaching the shot selection process because it will allow you to know exactly where the camera should be.

 The camera position depends on a number of factors, including the video's aesthetics or the action that takes place in the shot, and you have to go through this process for each shot in your video.

Need a gaming headset? The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, youâ€™ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.

Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024\. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:

 **[1\. Razer Man O'War 7.1](#razer)**

**[2\. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset](#audiotech)**

**[3\. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430](#logitec)**

**[4\. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset](#kraken)**

**[5\. HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset](#hyper)**

## **1\. [Razer Man Oâ€™ War 7.1](https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-manowar-7.1)**

**![Razer Man O'War 7.1 Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-man-headset1.jpg)**

**Price:** $222.48

**Compatible with:** PC, Mac (with USB), PlayStation, Xbox

This wireless headset has an impressive surround sound engine that allows for an immersive gaming experience and convincing positional audio. The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man Oâ€™War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.

The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.

**Pros:**

 **\-** Wireless setup for maximum freedom

   **\-** Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups

 **\-** Lightweight and comfortable to wear

 **\-** Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone

 **\-** Long-lasting batteries â€“ up to 14 hours

**Cons:**

 **\-** Occasional loss of connectivity

   **\-** Slightly expensive for a plastic build

## **2\. [Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/97d660ada89c32c8/index.html)**

**![Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-technica-headset2.jpg)**

**Price:** $299

**Compatible with:** PC, PS4, iPad, iPhone, Xbox (with adapter)

For a gaming headset, this model boasts a really impressive audio quality. This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.

As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.

**Pros:**

 **\-** Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort

 **\-** Top-notch audio quality above its class

 **\-** Innovative, self-adjusting frame

 **\-** Comfortable ear cups

**Cons:**

   **\-** Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device

 **\-** Specialized product with a narrow range of applications

 **\-** Fragile build that can easily be damaged

 **\-** Very expensive

## **3\. [Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/product/g430-7-1-surround-sound-gaming-headset)**

**![Logitec G430 Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitec-gaming-headset3.jpg)**

**Price:** $79.99

**Compatible with:** PC, PS4

Logitec is well known for producing high-quality peripherals, and this model lives up to that standard despite its affordable price. Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.

A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone canâ€™t be easily manipulated and doesnâ€™t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, thatâ€™s a fair compromise.

**Pros:**

 **\-** Realistic, immersive sound

 **\-** Smart design optimized to decrease weight

 **\-** The Durable cloth covering the ear cups

 **\-** Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset

 **\-** Excellent price-to-quality ratio

**Cons:**

 **\-** Lack of programmable commands

 **\-** Poor protection against ambient noise

 **\-** Less than impressive visually

## **4\. [Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset](https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-kraken-71-v2)**

**![Razer Kraken Chroma Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kraken-headset4.jpg)**

**Price:** $96.77

**Compatible with** **:** PC, PS4

If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man Oâ€™ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.

Krakenâ€™s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when itâ€™s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals wonâ€™t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. Itâ€™s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.

**Pros:**

 **\-** Excellent audio for its price range

 **\-** Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience

 **\-** Completely isolates any ambient sounds

 **\-** Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way

 **\-** Access to Synapse 2.0 software

**Cons:**

 **\-** USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks

 **\-** Lack of preset settings for gaming

 **\-** A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds

## **5\. [HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/us/headsets/cloud-gaming-headset)**

**![HyperX Cloud II Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperx-cloud-headset5.jpg)**

**Price:** $99.88

**Compatible** **with:** PC, Mac, Xbox, PS4, Mobile

Well designed, packed with advanced features and moderately priced, this gaming headset offers a lot of value to the YouTube crowd. It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.

The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.

**Pros:**

 **\-** b and elegant aluminum frame

 **\-** Advanced audio control box

 **\-** Virtual 7.1 surround audio

 **\-** Interchangeable ear pads

 **\-** Premium look and feel at an affordable price

**Cons:**

 **\-** Inconveniently positioned mute switch

 **\-** Relatively short cord limiting movement

Need a gaming headset? The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, youâ€™ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.

Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024\. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:

 **[1\. Razer Man O'War 7.1](#razer)**

**[2\. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset](#audiotech)**

**[3\. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430](#logitec)**

**[4\. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset](#kraken)**

**[5\. HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset](#hyper)**

## **1\. [Razer Man Oâ€™ War 7.1](https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-manowar-7.1)**

**![Razer Man O'War 7.1 Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-man-headset1.jpg)**

**Price:** $222.48

**Compatible with:** PC, Mac (with USB), PlayStation, Xbox

This wireless headset has an impressive surround sound engine that allows for an immersive gaming experience and convincing positional audio. The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man Oâ€™War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.

The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.

**Pros:**

 **\-** Wireless setup for maximum freedom

   **\-** Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups

 **\-** Lightweight and comfortable to wear

 **\-** Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone

 **\-** Long-lasting batteries â€“ up to 14 hours

**Cons:**

 **\-** Occasional loss of connectivity

   **\-** Slightly expensive for a plastic build

## **2\. [Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/97d660ada89c32c8/index.html)**

**![Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-technica-headset2.jpg)**

**Price:** $299

**Compatible with:** PC, PS4, iPad, iPhone, Xbox (with adapter)

For a gaming headset, this model boasts a really impressive audio quality. This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.

As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.

**Pros:**

 **\-** Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort

 **\-** Top-notch audio quality above its class

 **\-** Innovative, self-adjusting frame

 **\-** Comfortable ear cups

**Cons:**

   **\-** Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device

 **\-** Specialized product with a narrow range of applications

 **\-** Fragile build that can easily be damaged

 **\-** Very expensive

## **3\. [Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/product/g430-7-1-surround-sound-gaming-headset)**

**![Logitec G430 Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitec-gaming-headset3.jpg)**

**Price:** $79.99

**Compatible with:** PC, PS4

Logitec is well known for producing high-quality peripherals, and this model lives up to that standard despite its affordable price. Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.

A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone canâ€™t be easily manipulated and doesnâ€™t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, thatâ€™s a fair compromise.

**Pros:**

 **\-** Realistic, immersive sound

 **\-** Smart design optimized to decrease weight

 **\-** The Durable cloth covering the ear cups

 **\-** Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset

 **\-** Excellent price-to-quality ratio

**Cons:**

 **\-** Lack of programmable commands

 **\-** Poor protection against ambient noise

 **\-** Less than impressive visually

## **4\. [Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset](https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-kraken-71-v2)**

**![Razer Kraken Chroma Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kraken-headset4.jpg)**

**Price:** $96.77

**Compatible with** **:** PC, PS4

If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man Oâ€™ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.

Krakenâ€™s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when itâ€™s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals wonâ€™t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. Itâ€™s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.

**Pros:**

 **\-** Excellent audio for its price range

 **\-** Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience

 **\-** Completely isolates any ambient sounds

 **\-** Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way

 **\-** Access to Synapse 2.0 software

**Cons:**

 **\-** USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks

 **\-** Lack of preset settings for gaming

 **\-** A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds

## **5\. [HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/us/headsets/cloud-gaming-headset)**

**![HyperX Cloud II Headset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperx-cloud-headset5.jpg)**

**Price:** $99.88

**Compatible** **with:** PC, Mac, Xbox, PS4, Mobile

Well designed, packed with advanced features and moderately priced, this gaming headset offers a lot of value to the YouTube crowd. It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.

The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.

**Pros:**

 **\-** b and elegant aluminum frame

 **\-** Advanced audio control box

 **\-** Virtual 7.1 surround audio

 **\-** Interchangeable ear pads

 **\-** Premium look and feel at an affordable price

**Cons:**
