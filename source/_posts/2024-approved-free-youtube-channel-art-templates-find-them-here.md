## 2\. [Canva](https://www.canva.com)

_Phil from Video School Online’s Canva tutorial._

Canva is a free online program you can use to create all kinds of graphics easily ([learn how to use Canva here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-youtube-banner-for-free-using-canva-116.html)), and they even have templates you can use to make YouTube channel art. Using a template on Canva is as easy as clicking on the one you want and then dragging and dropping in your own images (if you don’t want to use theirs) and changing what the text says.

Although Canva is free to use, and includes many free options for graphics and stock photos, it does also have some premium images and clip art which cost $1 each to use. Making a free banner is as easy as making sure none of the paid elements are in your design (they’re watermarked, so you’ll know).

## 3\. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. It has various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc. You can create a beautiful design by simply dragging and dropping the elements and photos.

PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.

But today the software industry has given us well-equipped tools for video making or editing. Video editors are on huge demand in various sectors starting from academics to business professions. Whether making a video tutorial or a creative content, video editing software is handy. Creating funny videos is the next big thing after the comedy scenes of the movies. To capture funny moments or to perform a funny act, certain video editing skills can be used. Then one can share these videos on the public platforms and gain praise. Social platforms like Youtube and Instagram are filled with such creative content. It gives the person a unique opportunity to show his/her talent in front of everyone with the help of these tools.

**How to make a parody video?**

If you want to know **how to make a parody video** then follow the below steps:

* **Finding the perfect song:**
* **Getting the correct music:** To get the right music, Youtube will be a suitable platform.
* **Recording suitable lyrics:** The lyrics can be recorded with the help of a microphone in-built with computers. In the absence of a microphone, a video camera will do the work as a substitute. The operating system running under Windows will give the option of Windows movie maker as the recording tool. GarageBand and iMovie will serve the purpose if the user has a Mac operating device. The ultimate goal is a smooth recording. The area of the recording should be soundproof or should have minimum external noise interference. The professional studios have soundproof walls of the rooms for recording. But this is not the case here. Any quiet place is sufficiently suitable for the recording. The pitch and quality of the voice must not be too rough or too fast. Practicing for a few cycles before the final recording will be perfect.
* **Making a music video:** The newly created parody will get the maximum benefit if it collaborates with a music video. Only with the help of a video camera, the filming can be done. There should be proper sync between the music video and the parody. Before filming everything should be planned. The location of the shoot should be confirmed beforehand. The background should meet the theme of the song and parody. It is required to carry all the costumes and props to the location of the shoot. Once the video is shot, now it is time for attaching the two clips to make a single impactful video. Use powerful video editing tools to get what you want- Filmora can help you make it.
