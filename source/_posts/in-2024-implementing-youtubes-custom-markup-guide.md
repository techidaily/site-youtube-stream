YouTube Annotations and Cards are both tools for linking viewers to your other videos or to off-YouTube webpages. Two of the major differences between them are:

Annotations are not clickable on mobile devices.

You cannot choose the size or positioning of Cards.

This article will teach you about both Cards and Annotations and discuss the best uses for each of them.

**Part 1: Annotations**

Annotations are messages that float overtop of your videos in the YouTube player. Usually, annotations are clickable and take users to other content created by you.

**Section 1: Types of Annotations**

There are five types of YouTube annotations:

**Notes** are colored boxes placed over the top of your videos.

**Speech Bubbles** look like dialogue boxes in a comic strip. They have tails that you can adjust so it looks like one of the people in your video is saying what is written in the annotation.

**Spotlights** have a subtle border and are completely clear inside. Your text only appears when a viewer’s cursor hovers over top of these annotations.

**Labels** are like spotlights except that viewers do not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.

Any of these annotations can be used to link viewers to other videos, or as subscribe links. You can also add a simple **Title** to your video through the Annotations menu.

**Section 2: How to Use Annotations**

\*Note: the above video mentions Pause annotations, which are no longer available.

Here are two of the best uses for annotations:

**Clickable End Cards / Outros**

One of the best ways you can use spotlight annotations is to create clickable end cards for your videos.

When your video finishes playing the YouTube player will display a selection of suggested videos that might direct viewers away from your channel. You can keep more of these viewers watching your content by creating your own ‘suggested videos’ card and putting it at the end of your videos.

Put thumbnails of two or three of your other videos on your end card, or use ‘picture-in-picture’ to actually imbed footage from them. Then, after you upload your video, go in and place clickable spotlight annotations over top of your video thumbnails.

This is one use for annotations that cannot be duplicated with cards.

**Promoting Your Videos**

You should not wait until the end of your video to start linking viewers to other content. Many viewers will click away before they see your end card because your video is not exactly what they were looking for. By placing note or speech bubble annotations occasionally throughout your videos you can catch some of these people before they click off of your channel.

This works especially well if you link to videos on similar subjects to the one you are annotating.

Instead of just linking to another video of yours, try to link to that video on a playlist. Once a viewer is on a playlist your videos will auto-play after each other, which is good for both your view count and watch time.

You can also use the newer YouTube Cards for this, but Annotations might still be a better choice because viewers only need to click once vs. twice for Cards.

Try both and see which performs best for your channel. It might be in your best interest to keep on using both as they target different audiences – Cards are clickable on mobile devices, for example, but Annotations are not.

#### **Part 2: YouTube Cards**

YouTube Cards are newer than annotations and a lot of people believe they will one day replace Annotations. While there are benefits to Cards – like embedding images to represent your links – you cannot choose the shape, size, or placement of them. This means they have limited uses.

When viewers click on a Card they are shown additional information and a thumbnail representing the page they will be taken to if they choose to click again. This extra step could be either help viewers decide to click your links or give them a second chance to decide they would rather not.

**Section 1: When to Use Cards**

A linked Annotation is simply a call to action viewers can click on. A Card is a call to action as well, but instead of taking the viewer directly to where its link leads when it is clicked a Card opens up into a larger version of itself with a thumbnail image.

Crowdfunding pages (Patreon is a great choice for video creators), charity fundraising pages, and merchandise stores are all examples of links that benefit from the format of YouTube Cards.

When you link a viewer to a non-YouTube page you break up their session time, which negatively impacts your watch time and SEO ranking. You want to make sure that the viewers you are directing away from YouTube are the ones most likely to convert after they leave. By ‘convert’ we mean to contribute to your Patreon campaign, donate to the charity you are promoting, or buy some of your merchandise.

Giving viewers more information and a thumbnail through a Card can help ensure the most interested viewers are the ones clicking your links.

### Video editing options and features in the YouTube Studio App

When creators are on the go, YouTube Studio is the best way to manage their channels. The desktop site, however, lacks a number of basic features.

#### Comment Filters: New Features

YouTube is bringing comment filters to its Studio app for the first time. By using these, certain types of comments can be searched more easily. At thе bottom of thе scrееn, click Commеnts, thеn usе thе buttons at the top to sеt your filtеr. Thеrе arе sеvеral filters availablе, including:

* Status of response: Did I respond to this comment already?
* The subscriber count: what is the commenter's subscriber count?
* Status of subscriber: Does the commentator subscribe to me publicly?
* Is there a question: did someone ask a question in the comment?
* Member status: Does the commenter belong to the channel?
* Search: Is there a specific word in any comments?

![android comment filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-9.jpg)

#### The Studio app now has analytics options

Along with their desktop app, YouTube is now offering useful analytics information on their mobile app. Data and graphs provide channel-level insights that creators can use to track channel performance. You can view all the different charts of information by tapping Analytics in the navigation bar.

![android analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-10.jpg)

#### Appeals for mobile monetization

If appropriate, the appealed video's monetization status will be reviewed by a human policy specialist. Select the yellow $ icon and tap Request review on a video with limited monetization.

![android monetization options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-11.jpg)

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.

YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Thе navigation bar at thе bottom

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.
