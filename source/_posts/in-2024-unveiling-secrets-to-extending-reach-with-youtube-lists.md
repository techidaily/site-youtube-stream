## Unveiling Secrets to Extending Reach with YouTube Lists

YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.

But what if you've created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we've put together an extensive guide on **how to** **share a YouTube playlist** on your computer and mobile devices.

So, let's get started with our guide without any further delay!

## Why Doesn't The Share Function In The Playlist Work?

Firstly, let's figure out why the "Share" function doesn't work. The "Share" function in the playlist does not work because it is set to "private," and YouTube doesn't allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to "public" in the following way:

Step1 Head to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.

Step2

* **Click** the three-line **"Menu"** icon at the top-left of your screen.
* Go to **"Library."**
* Scroll down to the **"Playlist"** section.

Step3 Select your playlist labeled as **"Private."** On the next page, click the **"Private"** option in the playlist details section and select **"Public"** to change the visibility of your playlist.

Once the privacy setting has been changed, the **"share"** function will work as intended.

Step1 Visit the **YouTube website** using a browser on your computer and sign in to your account. Click your **Profile** in the top-right of the screen and select **"Your Channel"** from the drop-down menu, which will take you to your YouTube channel's dashboard.

That's it! The recipient will now be able to watch the entire YouTube playlist you've shared.

##### How To Share A YouTube Playlist With A Link To Collaborate

Through the "Collaborate on playlists" feature, YouTube allows you to add friends to your playlist, who can then add videos to it.

Here's how you can share a YouTube playlist with a link to collaborate with your friends:

Step1 In the first step, go to the **YouTube** website using your preferred browser, and sign in to your channel's [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/mail/) account using your email address and password.

Step2 Click your **"Profile"** icon, choose the **"Your Channel"** option from the drop-down menu and go to the **"Playlist."**

Step3 In the next step, click the **"View Full Playlist"** option under your preferred playlist. This will take you to your playlist page.

Step4 In the details section of your YouTube playlist on the playlist page, click the **three dots (ellipsis)** icon and select the **"Collaborate"** option.

An intro video goes a long way towards building your brand and showing viewers that you’re serious about YouTube. Here’s where you can make or download intros, plus some tips on making intros that support the growth of your channel.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Free Intro Makers

Here’s a list of 4 places you can create or download FREE YouTube intros with no watermark.

#### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Blender is a free, open-source, ‘3D creation suite’. It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.

This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.

What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and [Velosofy](#velosofy).

#### [Movietools](http://www.movietools.info/)

This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.

You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and/or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.

Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.

#### [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

 For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.

A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.

Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.

In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.

The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word/line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.

Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.

#### [Velosofy](https://www.velosofy.com/)

Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.

Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is [Blender](#blender), the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.

## 5 Tips for Making a Great Intro

Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.

#### 1\. Keep it Under 10 Seconds

Someone who doesn’t know you, who is shopping around for the best video to watch on a particular topic, will not have the patience to sit through a long intro. In order to stop them from clicking away, you’ll need to keep your intro short. Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.

Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.

#### 2\. Match Your Channel’s Branding

Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.

Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.

#### 3\. Use Music

Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.

#### 4\. Include Your Channel Name

This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.

#### 5\. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro

Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.

 What's your YouTube intro like? Can you think of a way you'd like to change or improve it?

An intro video goes a long way towards building your brand and showing viewers that you’re serious about YouTube. Here’s where you can make or download intros, plus some tips on making intros that support the growth of your channel.

## Free Intro Makers

Here’s a list of 4 places you can create or download FREE YouTube intros with no watermark.

#### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Blender is a free, open-source, ‘3D creation suite’. It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.

This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.

What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and [Velosofy](#velosofy).

#### [Movietools](http://www.movietools.info/)

This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.

You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and/or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.

Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.

#### [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

 For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.

A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.

Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.

In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.

The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word/line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.

Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.

#### [Velosofy](https://www.velosofy.com/)

Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.

Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is [Blender](#blender), the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.

## 5 Tips for Making a Great Intro

Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.

#### 1\. Keep it Under 10 Seconds

Someone who doesn’t know you, who is shopping around for the best video to watch on a particular topic, will not have the patience to sit through a long intro. In order to stop them from clicking away, you’ll need to keep your intro short. Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.

Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.

#### 2\. Match Your Channel’s Branding

Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.

Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.

#### 3\. Use Music

Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.

#### 4\. Include Your Channel Name

This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.

#### 5\. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro

Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.

 What's your YouTube intro like? Can you think of a way you'd like to change or improve it?
