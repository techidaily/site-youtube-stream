Ever think about how to get a YouTube video trending? It can come down to picking a topic that's trending.

A trending topic is a subject which a lot of people are currently interested in. If you learn how to tap into what’s popular and cover it in creative and innovative ways then that will help your channel grow more quickly. You’ll get more views, more subscribers, and higher search rankings by following these simple tips.

1. **[Think of 'Trending' as Relevant](#relevant)**
2. **[Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche](#niche)**
3. **[Aim for Number 1](#aim)**
4. **[Success Doesn't Mean Making a Viral Video](#viral)**
5. **[The Subscriber Snowball Effect](#snowball)**

[![guide-to-grow-youtube-subscribers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide-to-grow-youtube-subscribers-download-btn.png)](https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers?utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fcampaign=get%5Fsubs%5Fevergreen&utm%5Fcontent=blog%202)

## **1\. Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant**

Instead of thinking of a trending video as a video that everyone is doing, think of it as a subject that is relevant to a lot of people. You want to cover topics that a lot of people care about.

A lot of YouTubers see huge channels have a lot of success posting videos that are very focused on the personal life of the creator (i.e. ‘I had the WORST day’) or which have very vague or sensational titles (i.e. ‘The horse knows what it did’) and decide that those are the kinds of videos they want to do too. However, the only reason large channels are able to be successful with these kinds of videos and titles is that they are already big. These creators have already grown themselves huge audiences of people who know and are interested in them personally.

As a smaller creator, you will not be successful if you only aim to do videos that are focused on you and your life. For example, if you have 100 subscribers and make a vlog about how your day went, then you have 100 people who may potentially find that interesting. The content might be good, but it won’t help you grow.

## **2\. Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche**

**![find your niche](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/niche-find-your-niche.jpg)**

Taking on trending topics shouldn’t mean taking on topics you aren’t actually interested in or don’t care about. Every genre on YouTube has its own trends, and you will often know about them just by virtue of watching other channels in your genre and talking to people who are interested in the same things as you. For example, if you’re a Gamer and your friends are also Gamers then you probably already know what Gamers are currently interested in.

If you do need help determining trends, here are 2 ways to do it:

1. Visit 3 of the most popular channels in your genre (i.e. gaming, beauty, or prank) and see if there’s any overlap in the themes of their most recent videos.
2. Go to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.ca/trends/) and look at the categories most relevant to your genre. [To learn how to use Google Trends](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## **3\. Aim for Number 1**

**![think-in-divergent-way](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-in-divergent-way.jpg)**

Being trendy doesn’t mean you can’t be original. If you know what’s popular in your genre then that will enable you to ask yourself ‘what’s on-trend, but not being covered yet?’.

For example, if you know that relationship videos – topics like ‘how do you know a guy likes you?’ – are doing well then you can think about what other aspects of dating people might be interested in that don’t have many videos on them yet. If you’re one of the first to tackle something that’s on-trend you have a much better chance of getting that number 1 search engine ranking, and higher ranked videos always get more views.

## **4\. Success Doesn't Mean Making a Viral Video**

**![viral-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viral-video.png)**

There’s a common misconception that in order to grow your channel you need to make your videos go viral. The truth is that having one or two viral videos probably won’t help you much. People don’t subscribe to one video, they subscribe for consistently good content.

It’s much better to have 10 videos on a popular topic that are doing alright than it is to have that one big viral hit. Those 10 videos will consistently bring in new viewers to your channel who are more likely to subscribe because they can see you have other content they’re interested in.

## **5\. The Subscriber Snowball Effect**

**![snowball-effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snowball-effect.jpg)**

When you make multiple videos around a trending topic, they’re more likely to come up as ‘related’ to each other than if you only cover the topic in one video. If someone enjoys one of your videos on that topic and can see there’s another right there in the related videos, there’s a good chance they’ll click on it.

This gets you more views on multiple videos, and more subscribers because it builds the expectation that you’re going to continue to keep covering relevant topics. Having viewers click from video to video on your channel also increases your watch time, which YouTube’s algorithm takes as a sign that they should rank your videos higher in search results (getting you even more views).

Do you have any of your own tips for how to get a YouTube video trending?

Finding the trend is integral for YouTube channel growth. A user-friendly video editing software will simplify the process of editing videos and saves your efforts. Get **Wondershare Filmora** by clicking the button below to make the coolest videos and see your viewers boom.

## Top 10 YouTube Makeup Artists

Here’s a rundown of our shortlisted ones in no particular order.

#### 1\.  Rachel Claire Levin

This internet personality is widely known for her YouTube channel RCLBeauty101\. A native of Philadelphia, who joined this channel on Dec 14, 2010, has successfully amassed 14.6M subscribers from all over the world. And why not? After all, her channel features diverse videos on life hacks, skits, comedy, and associated things besides DIY makeup tutorials. As of July 2020, the YouTube channel has already gathered 3.71 billion video views, indicating how quickly she’s reaching out to people seeking beauty advice.

#### 2\.  Jeffree Star

Jeffree Star, who is renowned on YouTube as ‘jeffreestar’, is a multi-talented internet personality. This fashion-obsessed influencer had embarked on his journey as a makeup artist on February 15, 2006\. Since then, he has been creating and sharing videos on collabs, life, music, reviews, and makeup of course. His channel has been immensely popular and has amassed 17.4M subscribers with video views soaring to over 2.35 billion. You would be surprised to know that he’s also the founder of Jeffree Star Cosmetics, which was launched in November 2014\. Sharing beauty tips and tutorials have risen on his channel ever since the very onset of his company.

#### 3\.  Nikkie de Jager

And how can we ever forget about the Dutch beauty vlogger, who owns a YouTube channel by the name NikkieTutorials? She’s a YouTube sensation with about 13.5M subscribers and over 1.33 billion views. Success touched her feet in 2015 when she released “The Power of Makeup” YouTube video and inspired people to disclose theirs with and without makeup faces. Her channel features stars like Drew Barrymore and Kim Kardashian, all of which have together contributed to the popularity of her YouTube channel.

#### 4\.  Wayne Goss

The YouTube channel of Wayne Goss is all about beauty tips to improve makeup skills, honest reviews on brands, and a guide for all those aspiring to be a makeup artist. What launched on August 5, 2008, today enjoys 3.79M subscribers and over 508 million video views. The best part about watching makeup tutorials on his channel is that he breaks down even the most complicated looks into easy and manageable segments, simplifying the learning for all.

#### 5\.  Desi Perkins

Desi Perkins’ humble entry into the YouTube community happened on August 18, 2013, when she posted a tutorial titled ‘Soft Warm Sultry Eye’ and since then she’s been taking over the channel by storm. A specialist in wedding, party and casual makeup styles, her rise to fame was mostly due to two of her videos ‘Husband Does My Makeup’ and ‘Eyebrow Tutorial’.
