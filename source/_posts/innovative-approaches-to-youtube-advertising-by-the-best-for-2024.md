## Innovative Approaches to YouTube Advertising by the Best

While there are a lot of ways you could advertise your business online, YouTube video ads are quickly becoming the most popular advertising solution. This is because more and more people choose to watch videos than any other form of video.

![youtube ad creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-ad-creator.jpg)

But to make sure that you are putting your best foot forward when it comes to video ads, you need to invest in a YouTube ad creator that is easy to use and effective. Here, we will be looking at the best YouTube video creators that you can use.

## Why Use YouTube Video Ads

Before we look at some of the tools you can use to create YouTube video ads, it is important to mention some of the reasons why you may want to choose YouTube ads over other solutions. YouTube ads when compared to PPC are relatively cheaper and you also choose how much you are willing to pay when a user clicks on the ads. This makes it unlikely that you could spend more than you intended to.

YouTube ads are also more targeted than any other form of advertising. You have a lot of options when choosing who you want to target including metrics such as demographics, topics, similar audiences, customer matches, life events, and more.

Since the ad is a video, it generates far more engagement than a text ad on any other platform. Even though it is an ad, the video is still a great way for your brand to connect with potential audiences.

## Types of Video Ads for YouTube

The following are the different types of YouTube ads that you can create;

****Video Discovery**

Video discover ads appear on the search page results and are usually composed of a thumbnail image and a few lines of text. They also have a very recognizable “Ad” in the box to let all users know that this is sponsored content.

****In-Stream Ads**

In-stream video ads can be skippable or non-skippable. Skippable in-stream video ads will often play for a minimum of 5 seconds before allowing the user to skip to the video content. Non-skippable in-stream video ads do not have the “skip” button and the user has to watch the video to the end.

****Pre-roll Ads**

A pre-roll ad is just an in-stream ad that is not skippable. It doesn’t give the user the option of skipping the app and they have to watch the entire ad before they can watch the video. The pre-roll video ad is usually 15 to 60 seconds long.

****Bumper Ads**

Bumper ads are tiny non-skippable 6-second ads that will play right before the video content loads. They can be an ideal way to promote an event or a new brand. Since they are only 6 seconds long, they can be very easy to make.

* Choose the type of ad you would like to create wisely. Learn the different types of YouTube ads and select one based on your brand, advertising budget, and projected reach.
* Use the YouTube targeting options to give your ads the best chance at success. Ensure that you are choosing the right targets to avoid spending money on targets that will not engage with your ad.
* You may also want to use your videos in a remarketing campaign. Remarketing targets the same audience that you targeted before, increasing your chances of getting more engagement.
* When creating the ad, ensure that the content in the ad is compelling and feels natural. Even though the audience will be watching sponsored content it should feel just like any other video.
* You can also drive more engagement by adding interactive elements to the video. These can be calls-to-action, auto-end screens, and cards to showcase your products.

# YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites

YouTube is a great platform where almost everyone goes to watches videos. It is not the best platform for every video creator, though. This article will introduce you to some YouTube alternatives.

There are a lot of reasons you might want to learn about other websites like YouTube. You might want a site with less ads, or different ways of monetizing. YouTube can sometimes remove videos unfairly, so you may want a site where copyright claims are handled by people instead of robots. A lot of users simply want a site that is more like YouTube was when it was younger. There are features, like customizable channel pages, which have been discarded over the years.

## YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites

Here is a list of other places where you can upload videos:

#### 1\. Dailymotion

![YouTune Alternatives - Dailymotion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-dailymotion.JPG)

This may be the second most popular free video sharing website, and it is very similar to YouTube in appearance. Like YouTube, Dailymotion recommends videos to users based on what is trending as well as their personal viewing habits. Also like YouTube, there are ads in and around videos and you have the option of monetizing your content to earn ad revenue. There is more than one way to become a Dailymotion partner, though. You can sell a subscription for your channel instead of monetizing ads in your videos.

The main difference between Dailymotion and YouTube is that where YouTube has an abundance of both amateur and professional quality video, Dailymotion skews towards professional. There are personal vlogs and cat videos, but these are less the norm on Dailymotion than on YouTube. You may find less competition in your genre here. However, you should be aware that the expectations of viewers might be higher.

#### 2\. Vimeo

![YouTube Alternatives - Vimeo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternative-vimeo.JPG)

Although Vimeo is also a very popular video site, it is very different from YouTube. Everything from appearance to the types of comments left on videos is vastly different. The front page of this site does not display trending videos, for example. Instead it features high quality creative content that has been reviewed and singled out by Vimeo’s staff as some of the best the site has to offer.

There also are not any ads on Vimeo, whereas YouTube is full of them.

If you create, or are interested in creating, short films then this is where you should be posting. Many festival quality shorts are posted to Vimeo. There are vlogs there too, but they tend to be by serious video creators. The community on Vimeo tends to be a lot friendlier than YouTube so if you are still an amateur, but have dreams of being a pro, then this is probably still the site for you. You should be able to find real constructive criticism here rather than trolls.

Vimeo has a wider variety of privacy settings than YouTube. You can make videos watchable by everyone, just certain people, or require a password.

#### 3\. ZippCast

![YouTune Alternatives - ZippCast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-zippcast.JPG)

ZippCast is praised by some for being very similar to pre-Google YouTube. While the expectations for video quality may be slightly higher on DailyMotion than YouTube, and are much higher on Vimeo, they are basically the same on ZippCast. Comedy, gaming, music, animation, and vlogging are the most popular categories and almost all content is posted by average people with average skill levels. One of the ways in which ZippCast is like the ‘old’ YouTube is that you can customize the design of your channel.

One of the things users appreciate most about ZippCast is that identifying and removing copyrighted videos is done by humans rather than an automated system, like on YouTube. This means that if you use copyrighted content that is licensed to you or protected by fair use your video should not be taken down. It is common for YouTubers to have their videos unfairly removed, although disputing the copyright claim will usually result in getting the video restored.

Although it is definitely large enough to be considered an alternative to YouTube, ZippCast has been unreliable in the past (i.e shutting down randomly) and has lost the trust of many users.
