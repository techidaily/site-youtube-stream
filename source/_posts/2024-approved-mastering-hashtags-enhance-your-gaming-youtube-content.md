### 3\. Use Some Fun Annotations

 YouTube is great for having unique and helpful graphics on the screen while your video is playing.

### 4\. Assume You Have New Viewers

 Do not create a YouTube channel trailer with inside jokes or comments. This trailer is for people who know nothing about you or your channel. You are trying to hook them into your content, not provide a few laughs to existing subscribers.

### 5\. Update Your Trailer Regularly

## Conclusion

 Creating a channel trailer for your YouTube page is a wonderful way to introduce a new audience to your content. They learn about you and the topics that you are passionate about. It convinces them to watch one of your videos and subscribe to your channel. And by using one of the YouTube Trailer Maker software options above, you will be creating quality trailers for your channel in no time!
