_Navin explains this issue really clearly._

YouTube announced changes to its Partnership Program for some time. For a long time, anybody who had an account in good standing could monetize their videos and start earning ad revenue, but now you need to have 10,000 views to qualify.

My first thought was that this isn’t fair. Small channels shouldn’t be barred from trying to earn money.

![ Become YouTube Partner should be easier](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hard-to-become-youtube-partner.jpg)

_I was prepared to go to war over this. Or do an angry blog post. One of those._

However, when you consider YouTube’s reasons for imposing this milestone, it actually starts to make a lot of sense. Here are 4 reasons why this will be a good thing for creators.

#### 1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number

This is actually a very do-able number for a smaller channel if the creator works hard at growing their audience. Remember that this is cumulative – you don’t need to get 10,000 views on a single video.

Say you receive about 100 views per video and post once a week. It would take you about 2 years to reach 10,000 at that rate, except that it wouldn’t because if you’re putting out good content on that reliable a schedule your channel will be growing (even if it’s slow).

If you get 500 views per video and post every week, you’ll reach 10,000 in about 5 months.

#### 2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money

![ the weight of 10,00 views on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-views-on-youtube-hard.jpg)

_Earning money from ad revenue has always been tough. This is just a little extra weight._

How much money could you earn off of 10,000 views, anyways? Not much.

You need to earn $50 in ad revenue to be paid out, and 10,000 views wouldn’t have gotten you there. You would have had to have passed this milestone anyways to actually see any money.

It’s too hard to put an exact number on the money you could have earned from your first 10,000 views – there are too many variables – but considering that smaller channels get lower-paying ads we’re probably talking about pocket change.

#### 3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized

YouTube has been having issues with advertisers lately. A lot of brands have been justifiably miffed that their products are appearing next to some violent, threatening, objectively offensive content. Anyone could monetize, and some pretty bad eggs took advantage of that.

Now that channels will be applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program instead of simply activating the feature, there can be a real screening process. Channels with content that violates YouTube’s Community Guidelines can be barred from monetization.

#### 4. Thieves won’t profit

There are people out there who want views, subscribers, and nice comments but who do not want to put any real work into getting them. It isn’t uncommon for someone like this to download a video they like and post it to their own channel.

This reposted video will steal views and ad revenue away from the real post on the creator’s channel.

Having a review process for the Partnership Program will help ensure that these content thieves are caught before they can make any money.

YouTube also recently made it easier to report users for impersonation, regardless of how many views they have.

_TheGamingGuy looked into people who had stolen his logo and found out they had also stolen whole videos from other YouTubers._

There are clear benefits to this new milestone, but there are also some questions remaining.

## How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?

It will help stop them from making money themselves, but not from siphoning away views from other channels. The impersonation rules only apply if somebody is pretending to be another creator. You can steal and repost someone’s content without pretending to be them.

This new rule does take away money as an incentive for stealing content, but a lot of people doing this probably aren’t in it for the money. They might just be misguided fans who want to repost videos they enjoy.

## Could this affect your CPM?

Competition plays a huge role in how much YouTubers earn from ad revenue. Some genres are bigger on YouTube than others and, the more popular your genre is, the more options advertisers have. The more competition there is for higher-paying ads, the larger your channel has to be to get them.

Could this new milestone decrease competition in some genres?

## Fast Fortnite Cover Art Techniques

# How to Make Fortnite Thumbnail for Free and Easy in 2024

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

To grow a Youtube channel, you need to focus on several different factors and elements. Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.

Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn't require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.

---

**Step 01:** To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg)

**Step 02:** If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2.jpg)

**Step 03:** For creating a perfect thumbnail, select "Drone Free Camera" mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want. Choose an angle of your choice and take the screenshot.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3.jpg)

**Step 04:** Open Filmora X, make sure to select the 16:9 screen ratio. Import the screenshot using the import button.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4.jpg)

**Step 05:** Drag and drop the screenshot into the timeline.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5.jpg)

**Step 06:** Now, let's separate the background and character. Go to the Effects, then AI Portrait, select Human Segmentation, and drop it into the screenshot.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6.jpg)

**Step 07:** Filmora will ask you to purchase it, but you can now hit "Try it" to use it.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7.jpg)

**Step 08:** It will remove the background of the screenshot.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8.jpg)

**Step 09:** To add a background, go to the media and navigate to "Sample Color." Drag a color of your choice and drop it below the screenshot.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9.jpg)

**Step 10:** To add titles in the Thumbnail, go to the Titles tab. Here you can find several categories of titles. Find your preferred title and drop it above all the layers. You can choose titles, lower thirds, and other texts depending upon your need and requirement.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10.jpg)

**Step 11:** We can make this Fortnite Thumbnail look more attractive by adding elements such as stickers and icons. Filmora contains a wide range of stickers. To access them, navigate to the Elements tab. Here you can find so many categories of elements. Choose any elements according to your need and drop them in the timeline above all other layers. If you cannot find a suitable sticker, you can download one from the internet and use it by importing it into Filmora.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11.jpg)

**Step 12:** Once you are satisfied with the final results, you can take the screenshot of the Thumbnail using the Snapshot icon located below the preview panel. It will create a screenshot in the media panel of Filmora.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12.jpg)

**Step 13:** To access the directory where this screenshot is saved, right-click on the screenshot and click on "Reveal in Explorer." It will open the folder that contains all the screenshots you take through Filmora. Your Fortnite Thumbnail is ready to be used on your Youtube videos.
