There are quite a few different YouTube partnership agreements that you can go for, depending on your needs and preferences. For instance, a Fullscreen partnership agreement requires you to share a percentage of your revenue in exchange for access to Fullscreen’s partnership perks. These perks include customized thumbnails as well as channel banners.

### How to Get a Fullscreen Partnership

Now that we’ve covered what the partnership actually is, let’s go ahead and take a look at how to actually become a Fullscreen partner. There are a few things that you should take into account before deciding to go down this road. There are regulations that your account needs to abide by. Let’s take a look:

1. Your account cannot have any copyright strikes and must be in good standing.
2. Your channel needs to be at least 30 days old.
3. You must have at least 1,000 subscribers.
4. You need to have received at least 100 views per day for the last 30 days.

If you meet these requirements, and Fullscreen sounds like a good fit for you, go ahead and [apply for partnership](http://fullscreenmedia.co/apply/). The first thing that you need to do is go to the Fullscreen website and find the Channels page. Scroll to the lowest point and request more information. Click the button to trigger the appearance of a form and write a message to Fullscreen. Once you’ve sent your message, Fullscreen is going to take between 1 and 7 days to respond. If accepted, you will have to sign a contract and provide screenshots that confirm that your account is in good standing on the YouTube.

### How Fullscreen Pays You

You’ve entered into a partnership agreement – now you need to start getting paid. The process is simple.

Fullscreen will pay you through PayPal. They will calculate how much you’ve earned, and you will get that amount transferred to your account. Make sure to check the amount that you’ve earned from the dashboard of Fullscreen itself.

Becoming a Fullscreen partner might be a good idea for your channel if the perks appeal to you. However, think about your own skills and whether you are confident in your ability to keep on growing your channel yourself. Fullscreen provides you with a wide range of comprehensive marketing tools, but a lot of video creators are able to master YouTube marketing using the tools YouTube already provides. Before you agree to split profits with an MCN (in addition to the portion already claimed by YouTube), make sure you are really going to be earning more profits than you could alone.
