 | ![ canon t7i](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel3.png)      | Best daily DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS T7i The camera you use to record your daily vlogs doesn't have to be the best camera on the market. It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  **PROS** _\- Long battery life_ _\- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values_   **CONS** _\- Can’t record 4K videos_ _\- Viewfinder is tiny_          |

| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png)       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you'll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_ |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png)         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera's great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There's a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you'll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                             |

 | ![ canon t7i](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel3.png)      | Best daily DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS T7i The camera you use to record your daily vlogs doesn't have to be the best camera on the market. It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  **PROS** _\- Long battery life_ _\- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values_   **CONS** _\- Can’t record 4K videos_ _\- Viewfinder is tiny_          |

| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png)       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you'll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_ |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png)         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera's great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There's a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you'll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                             |

The news channel distributes the most recent news events and information via television, radio, or the internet. People who work in news channels gather information from all over the world and convey it in the form of videos or audio. The content is created in a radio or television newsroom or by a broadcast network.

People nowadays don't have much time to read newspapers since they only scan the headlines of specific news stories, which provide inadequate information. So, the news channel is the quickest way to acquire any news, which an individual can view or listen to at any time via smartphones, laptops (via the internet), or radio.

The news channel has grown in popularity to disseminate or broadcast information to the rest of the world. The focus of television programming might shift. Some channels cover international or national issues, while others concentrate on weather, movie marketing, celebrity news, or sports.

![youtube news channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-news-channel-1.png)

Moreover, YouTube has also become an essential news source for many Americans. A quarter of all adults in the United States (26%) say they acquire their news from YouTube. And, while few of these people say it is their primary news source, the majority believe it is an important way for them to stay informed. People from all over the world and from all walks of life post videos on YouTube. As a result, there is a diverse range of videos available on YouTube. Some examples are amateur films, handmade music videos, sports bloopers, news, and other amusing situations captured on video.

## What Kind Of News Can You Get on YouTube?

On YouTube, you may find breaking news and popular stories.

#### On the site, there's a shelf for breaking News

Except for viewers under the age of 18, and a Breaking News shelf is shown on the YouTube homepage. The breaking news shelf on the YouTube homepage can be reached simply by scrolling down the YouTube homepage when a major news event occurs. If you're not interested, don't bother. The homepage's breaking news shelf can be turned off.

The information panel provides breaking news context in search results and will only offer text-based samples from a news story. In contrast, the content on the site will incorporate YouTube videos when they are available.

#### In search, the top News shelf

If you search for news, a Top News shelf appears in Search and has relevant information from news sources that follow Google News content policies. Regardless of age, the Top News shelf will appear.

#### Your homepage's top News shelf

If you watch or search for news information, a top news shelf on your homepage may appear. Regardless of age, the top news shelf will appear, with relevant items from news sources that adhere to Google News' content criteria.

#### Your homepage should have a COVID News shelf

On the homepage, a COVID-19 news shelf is now available. On our platform, there are news stories regarding COVID-19 from reliable news providers who respect Google News content policies and local health authorities. On the homepage, you can always hide the COVID-19 News shelf.

## Why Should You Use Youtube as a News Source?

Many people use YouTube to watch funny viral videos and make-up lessons. However, a sizable portion of the American population relies on YouTube for news.

According to a recent Pew Research Center research, YouTube channels are an important source of news and information for more than a quarter of all individuals in the United States. While that's a lot of people turning to YouTube for news, it's not surprising given that the platform is the world's second most-trafficked search engine, directly behind its sister business Google. People use YouTube as a source of information, but they're seeking video rather than text.

#### What Are the Benefits of Youtube News?

What's more surprising is that conventional news media organizations don't account for nearly as much of what consumers consume. According to the report, half of the individuals who get their news via YouTube watch independent channels. And, of those who use YouTube to keep up with current events, 72 percent believe the platform is either an important or the most significant source of information for them. Independent media on YouTube frequently covers situations and topics that the mainstream media may overlook. It's also often complementing, allowing viewers to understand the concerns better.

![youtube news channel - the benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-news-channel-2.png)

According to the Pew study, 66 percent of those who watch YouTube videos for news feel it helps them better comprehend current events. Sixty-eight percent said the videos maintain their attention and that they normally watch them intently rather than playing them in the background. Not only that, but when YouTube news users were asked to explain in their own words why YouTube is a unique place to get news, the most common responses were related to the content itself, such as access to news sources outside of the mainstream and the diversity of opinions and viewpoints available on the platform.
