How does YouTube count views? It’s not as simple as the number of clicks your video gets. If someone sits and refreshes your video over and over without letting it play for any significant time, those refreshes won’t be recorded as views. There is a lot more that goes into the calculation.

## Best YouTube Video Editor - Filmora

After you have created your YouTube channel, do you want to edit videos and upload your first video? Here we recommend using Filmora to easily edit YouTube videos.

You can use Filmora to make YouTube videos with built-in royalty-free audio. Filmora also can help you make YouTube intros. It includes more than 500 templates, transitions, effects, and text resources.

## 1\. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count

YouTube doesn’t provide a clear definition of what counts as a view, but we know that someone clicks on your video, and clicking right away doesn’t count. That’s how we know that watch time is a factor. Some studies conclude that a [full 30 seconds need to be viewed](https://buffer.com/library/social-video-metrics/#9) to register as one view, but there is no way to know for sure.

![how YouTube counts view](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-count-view.JPG)

## 2\. How Does YouTube Count Views?

YouTube wants to be sure that views are coming from humans and not bots. So, during the first couple of hours after you publish a video, YouTube seems to be stricter about what they count. The views which are counted are the ones that YouTube believes to be legitimate. Sometimes, it ends up skipping legitimate views for the sake of discretion.

Once this window of time passes, it is likely that you will see the view counter start to update a lot more frequently. The counter could still revert to updating slower and more hesitantly, though, if YouTube’s algorithm thinks it’s detecting something fishy.

At times, your view count can even be frozen temporarily until the algorithm can validate the views you are receiving. This is done to ensure a fair and positive experience for everyone who creates content. View counts can be adjusted by the algorithm in either direction.

## 3\. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?

Termed by many as one of the most boggling algorithms of all time, it is really hard to decode the complete dynamics of the YouTube view count algorithm.

There are some tests you can run yourself to try to unpack it.

If you upload a video and then [set it as unlisted](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it won’t get any public views so you can experiment by doing things like watching for different lengths of time and seeing what gets counted.

You’ll have to use a computer in a different location and make sure the account is not the same as the one you used to upload the video. Now, you need to watch the video for roughly 15 seconds. The key here is to keep it less than 30 seconds. You will see that the view did not add to the count. If you repeat this process on multiple computers at varying locations and with different accounts and you are likely to find the same result.

However, if you watch it for 30 seconds or longer it is likely that the count will go up.

We are adding ‘likely’ here because, despite this 30-second rule which has been decoded, there are other factors that might contribute to whether a view is counted as well as other automated scanning techniques at play.

Try to watch the same video numerous times in a single day. You will find that the count will add up at first, but after some time it will stop. YouTube knows that a lot of times people replay some videos over and over when they really enjoy them, and so they want to factor replays into their algorithm because they suggest quality. However, to avoid spam views, the counter will stop after a certain point.

## 4\. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don't Count

Something else that can affect whether a view is counted is the behavior of the account which watches it prior to landing on your video’s watch page. Sometimes, YouTube might feel that there is an increased chance a particular account is actually a bot, and then views from that account might not be added.

One way that [YouTube might flag an account as a potential bot](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27792330?hl=en) is if it is jumping between videos directly without navigating through recommendations, the search engine, or the account’s subscriber feed (how are they getting between these watch page URLs if they aren’t clicking on anything YouTube can record?). To add to it, if the viewer is watching each of the videos for almost 30 seconds exactly (or less) there is an increased probability that it is not a human but a bot (or a human watching the bare minimum as part of a view exchange program).

Any bot-like action will result in an account’s views do not be added to your view count.

## 5\. The Skip & Skim

It’s not uncommon for viewers to watch a video for say five seconds, skip forwards a bit and watch for another ten seconds as they look for a specific part. It is hard to say whether skipping through a video, but watching a scattered 30 seconds, would count as a view or not.

## 6\. Frozen YouTube View Counts

Sometimes YouTube will freeze a view count in order to check that it is accurate. When the count is unfrozen, the count may jump up as views are validated or it can go down if YouTube detects a problem.

You can use [YouTube’s analytics reports](https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/) to monitor an estimate of your potential views, but there is no assurance that this data will completely match your official view count.

## 7\. The 301 Mark

You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.

This is why view counts are often frozen at 301\. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.

During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, [YouTube says](https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away) it won't flag videos at 301 views anymore.

## Conclusion

In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots. Ultimately, ‘how does YouTube count views’ isn’t a question anyone but YouTube can answer for sure, but we do know it isn’t as simple as ‘a view is someone clicking on your video’.

You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.

This is why view counts are often frozen at 301\. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.

During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, [YouTube says](https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away) it won't flag videos at 301 views anymore.

## Conclusion

In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots. Ultimately, ‘how does YouTube count views’ isn’t a question anyone but YouTube can answer for sure, but we do know it isn’t as simple as ‘a view is someone clicking on your video’.

## Part 1: What Causes a YouTube Black Screen Error?

As mentioned earlier, although there could be any reason for **videos black on YouTube**, some of the most common ones are listed below:

**Obsolete Web Browser**

Because the websites and online portals are regularly updated by the developers to keep them secure from intruders and attackers, the web browsers must also be updated accordingly to keep up the pace. If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a **YouTube TV black screen**.

**Incompatible Browser Extensions**

This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.

**Slow Internet Connection**

This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.

**Stale DNS Cache**

Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.

**Outdated Display Driver**

As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience **YouTube black screen**.

## Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen \[\*Quick Way\]

Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the **YouTube video black screen** issue may differ. Nevertheless, some of the most effective remedies are discussed below in detail:

### 1\. Web Browser Solution(s)

**Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser**

When you experience **YouTube video black screen**, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:

Launch Google Chrome, click the **Customize and control Google Chrome** icon from the top-right corner, and then select **Update Google Chrome** from the menu that appears.

**Note:** If the **Update Google Chrome** option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser

**Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser**

If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.

**Solution 3: Use a Different Browser**

If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.

Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press **Enter** and see if the video plays correctly.

**Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser**

Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:

After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the **Customize and control Google Chrome** menu, and then go to **More tools**, and then select **Clear browsing data**.

![clear google chrome cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg)

Switch between the **Basic** and **Advanced** tabs on the **Clear browsing data** box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the **Time range** drop-down list.

![clear google chrome browsing data](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg)

Click **Clear data** from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.

**Solution 5: Disable/Remove the Extensions**

If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience **YouTube black screen**. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:

Launch Google Chrome and go to the **Customize and control Google Chrome** menu, go to **More tools,** then select **Extensions** from the submenu that appears.

Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.

![disable google chrome extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg)

**Note:** If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes **YouTube video black screen**. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click **Remove** to get rid of it altogether.

**Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser**

If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:

• Type **Control Panel** in the **Cortana** search box, and then click **Control Panel** from the results list.

• On the **Control Panel** window, click **Uninstall a program** from under the **Programs**

• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select **Uninstall** from above the list.

• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC. Next, use Microsoft Edge (or any other browser) to download and install a fresh copy of Google Chrome and see if the issue is fixed

### 2\. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)

If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:

**Solution 1: Get Your PC/Laptop Closer to the Router**

If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.

**Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network**

If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop/desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.

**PC/Windows Solution(s)**

At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:

**Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache**

Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:

Type **CMD** in the **Cortana** search box, and click **Run as administrator** from the right menu of the results list.

Click **Yes** on the **User Account Control** confirmation box, and in the **Command Prompt** window, type **IPCONFIG /FLUSHDNS** and press Enter

![use command to fix YouTube black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg)

Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed

**Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver**

Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card. Since a driver is needed to interact with the device, an old one might prevent the videos from getting displayed. If the graphics card is the culprit, the chances are that you won’t be able to see any video at all, be it from YouTube or offline. Therefore, checking if you are using the latest version of the graphic card driver wouldn’t harm you. The process is given below:

Right-click **Start** and go to **Device Manager** from the context menu

Expand the **Display adapters** tree on the **Device Manager** snap-in, and right-click the graphics card from the list and select **Update driver** from the context menu.

![upgrade graphic card to fix YouTube black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upgrade-graphic-card-to-fix-youtube-video-black-screen.jpg)

Click **Search automatically for drivers** from the next screen that appears and follow the on-screen instructions from there to update the graphic card driver.

**Note:** If your PC has multiple graphic cards installed in it, you will have to follow this procedure for each of them individually.

## Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?

If you wish to watch online videos on your smartphone, but experience **YouTube video black screen**, the process of fixing the issue on the phones is comparatively simple. The steps that are given below explain the procedure:

### How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Android

**Clear the Cache**

Go to **Settings** and then tap **Apps** from the **Settings** Go to YouTube and then scroll down to Storage.

Tap it and then select **Clear data and Clear cache**. Relaunch YouTube and see if the issue is fixed.

## Part 1: What Causes a YouTube Black Screen Error?

As mentioned earlier, although there could be any reason for **videos black on YouTube**, some of the most common ones are listed below:

**Obsolete Web Browser**

Because the websites and online portals are regularly updated by the developers to keep them secure from intruders and attackers, the web browsers must also be updated accordingly to keep up the pace. If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a **YouTube TV black screen**.

**Incompatible Browser Extensions**

This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.

**Slow Internet Connection**

This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.

**Stale DNS Cache**

Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.

**Outdated Display Driver**

As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience **YouTube black screen**.

## Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen \[\*Quick Way\]

Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the **YouTube video black screen** issue may differ. Nevertheless, some of the most effective remedies are discussed below in detail:

### 1\. Web Browser Solution(s)

**Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser**

When you experience **YouTube video black screen**, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:

Launch Google Chrome, click the **Customize and control Google Chrome** icon from the top-right corner, and then select **Update Google Chrome** from the menu that appears.

**Note:** If the **Update Google Chrome** option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser

**Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser**

If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.

**Solution 3: Use a Different Browser**

If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.

Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press **Enter** and see if the video plays correctly.

**Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser**

Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:

After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the **Customize and control Google Chrome** menu, and then go to **More tools**, and then select **Clear browsing data**.

![clear google chrome cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg)

Switch between the **Basic** and **Advanced** tabs on the **Clear browsing data** box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the **Time range** drop-down list.

![clear google chrome browsing data](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg)

Click **Clear data** from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.

**Solution 5: Disable/Remove the Extensions**

If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience **YouTube black screen**. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:

Launch Google Chrome and go to the **Customize and control Google Chrome** menu, go to **More tools,** then select **Extensions** from the submenu that appears.

Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.

![disable google chrome extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg)

**Note:** If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes **YouTube video black screen**. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click **Remove** to get rid of it altogether.

**Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser**

If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:

• Type **Control Panel** in the **Cortana** search box, and then click **Control Panel** from the results list.

• On the **Control Panel** window, click **Uninstall a program** from under the **Programs**

• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select **Uninstall** from above the list.

• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC. Next, use Microsoft Edge (or any other browser) to download and install a fresh copy of Google Chrome and see if the issue is fixed

### 2\. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)

If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:

**Solution 1: Get Your PC/Laptop Closer to the Router**

If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.

**Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network**

If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop/desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.

**PC/Windows Solution(s)**

At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:

**Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache**

Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:

Type **CMD** in the **Cortana** search box, and click **Run as administrator** from the right menu of the results list.

Click **Yes** on the **User Account Control** confirmation box, and in the **Command Prompt** window, type **IPCONFIG /FLUSHDNS** and press Enter

![use command to fix YouTube black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg)

Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed

**Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver**

Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card. Since a driver is needed to interact with the device, an old one might prevent the videos from getting displayed. If the graphics card is the culprit, the chances are that you won’t be able to see any video at all, be it from YouTube or offline. Therefore, checking if you are using the latest version of the graphic card driver wouldn’t harm you. The process is given below:

Right-click **Start** and go to **Device Manager** from the context menu

Expand the **Display adapters** tree on the **Device Manager** snap-in, and right-click the graphics card from the list and select **Update driver** from the context menu.

![upgrade graphic card to fix YouTube black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upgrade-graphic-card-to-fix-youtube-video-black-screen.jpg)

Click **Search automatically for drivers** from the next screen that appears and follow the on-screen instructions from there to update the graphic card driver.

**Note:** If your PC has multiple graphic cards installed in it, you will have to follow this procedure for each of them individually.
