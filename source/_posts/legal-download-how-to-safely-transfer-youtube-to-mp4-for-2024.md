## What's the best YouTube video size for you?

 It is recommended by professionals to use the YouTube video dimensions 1080p, or 1920 x 1080.

 These ones are the ideal because it will not only facilitate the video with a professional and elite look but also consumes relatively much less data. Moreover, if you use a phone for recording your videos then using the quality higher than the ones mentioned above will cost you with ample memory.

 If you are a newbie to the world of YouTube and want to up the device's storage game then 720p would still do wonders.

## What is the video aspect ratio?

 This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of "width x height.

 That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 unit wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.

 The aspect ratio of a video merely refers to the relationship among the width and height respectively and not the actual physical size of the image.

 The most common aspect ratios used in the video are depicted below for sound understanding:

![dimensions of a youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-aspect-ratios.jpg)

 Image from learn.g2

 The aspect ratio is the proportion of your video. This image displays the three most common aspect ratios.

 Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of height and width although dimensions refer to two separate measurements of height and width rather than a ratio with "pixel" as its unit.

## Standard aspect ratios

 Below are the most common aspect ratios used for the video. There may be certain amendments to the ones mentioned below but the following formats are used mostly by the film and video makers.

 Let's review the quick breakdown of the available aspect ratio options that you can opt accordingly:

| Aspect ratio | Application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1:1 or 1x1   | This aspect ratio will mostly be seen in the Instagram video. This 1:1 ratio gives a video a perfect square shape.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4:3 or 4x3   | This aspect ratio was mostly seen few ages ago in almost the amidst 20th century on the TV. This was used to be a standard television format back then. So if you are a 90's kid or an adult then you must be familiar with this format while watching your favorite old schooled sitcoms! |
| 16:9 or 16x9 | The format was enhanced to 16:9 aspect ratio for more HD quality and better viewing experience. This format is widely being used in televisions, theatres, DVD or high definition professional videos.                                                                                     |
| 21:9 or 21x9 | For more than merely an HD video quality and astonishing user experience, the formats have been upgraded to 21:9 aspect ratio. This is dominantly being used in the cinema for movie theatre releases.                                                                                     |

## The right aspect ratio for YouTube videos

 YouTube recommends using an aspect ratio of **16:9**  according to the video player that YouTube uses. You are also given an option to upload your videos vertically but this will amend the aspect ratio respectively.

 When you upload a video with an aspect ratio other than the one mention formerly then YouTube will automatically place the black bars on the sides. This is done to display the best quality video with the right resolution otherwise it will be displayed as distorted or cropped.

 A vertical ratio with may be 4:3 video aspect ratio will be displayed like the image given below:

 YouTube offers two main areas for image display of your channel. One is an icon image while other is what YouTube calls "Channel Art". This is the same as Facebook's cover photo. People often call it "YouTube banner". It is a header image displayed at the top of your channel.

![youtube video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-banner-size.jpg)

 For each kind of display (mobile, desktop, and TV), channel art (or banner) dimension changes accordingly.

 Either your cover photo or your YouTube banner is displayed at the top of the channel so it's highly significant to consider what you are depicting about your channel through these images.

 Hence, this being said or realized, selecting the appropriate banner resolution should be among your topmost priorities.

 The recommended banner dimensions of a YouTube video as suggested by YouTube are 2560 x 1440 pixels. But the dimensions may slightly vary with the variation in the devices being used by the users.

The unit or term is applicable for film, cameras, motion capture, video, and computer graphics. This is also known as "frame frequency", expressed in the unit "hertz"

**Resolution**

 It basically refers to the number of different pixels in each dimension which can be viewed in any display device.

**File Size**

 File size refers to the space that a file occupies in a storage medium, like hard drive or USB. The measure of file sizes can be expressed in bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and so on.

## What's the best YouTube video size for you?

 It is recommended by professionals to use the YouTube video dimensions 1080p, or 1920 x 1080.

 These ones are the ideal because it will not only facilitate the video with a professional and elite look but also consumes relatively much less data. Moreover, if you use a phone for recording your videos then using the quality higher than the ones mentioned above will cost you with ample memory.

 If you are a newbie to the world of YouTube and want to up the device's storage game then 720p would still do wonders.

## What is the video aspect ratio?

 This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of "width x height.

 That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 unit wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.

 The aspect ratio of a video merely refers to the relationship among the width and height respectively and not the actual physical size of the image.

 The most common aspect ratios used in the video are depicted below for sound understanding:

![dimensions of a youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-aspect-ratios.jpg)

 Image from learn.g2

 The aspect ratio is the proportion of your video. This image displays the three most common aspect ratios.

 Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of height and width although dimensions refer to two separate measurements of height and width rather than a ratio with "pixel" as its unit.

## Standard aspect ratios

 Below are the most common aspect ratios used for the video. There may be certain amendments to the ones mentioned below but the following formats are used mostly by the film and video makers.

 Let's review the quick breakdown of the available aspect ratio options that you can opt accordingly:

| Aspect ratio | Application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1:1 or 1x1   | This aspect ratio will mostly be seen in the Instagram video. This 1:1 ratio gives a video a perfect square shape.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4:3 or 4x3   | This aspect ratio was mostly seen few ages ago in almost the amidst 20th century on the TV. This was used to be a standard television format back then. So if you are a 90's kid or an adult then you must be familiar with this format while watching your favorite old schooled sitcoms! |
| 16:9 or 16x9 | The format was enhanced to 16:9 aspect ratio for more HD quality and better viewing experience. This format is widely being used in televisions, theatres, DVD or high definition professional videos.                                                                                     |
| 21:9 or 21x9 | For more than merely an HD video quality and astonishing user experience, the formats have been upgraded to 21:9 aspect ratio. This is dominantly being used in the cinema for movie theatre releases.                                                                                     |

## The right aspect ratio for YouTube videos

 YouTube recommends using an aspect ratio of **16:9**  according to the video player that YouTube uses. You are also given an option to upload your videos vertically but this will amend the aspect ratio respectively.

 When you upload a video with an aspect ratio other than the one mention formerly then YouTube will automatically place the black bars on the sides. This is done to display the best quality video with the right resolution otherwise it will be displayed as distorted or cropped.

 A vertical ratio with may be 4:3 video aspect ratio will be displayed like the image given below:

### 3\. Perfect size for your YouTube banner

 YouTube offers two main areas for image display of your channel. One is an icon image while other is what YouTube calls "Channel Art". This is the same as Facebook's cover photo. People often call it "YouTube banner". It is a header image displayed at the top of your channel.

![youtube video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-banner-size.jpg)

 For each kind of display (mobile, desktop, and TV), channel art (or banner) dimension changes accordingly.

 Either your cover photo or your YouTube banner is displayed at the top of the channel so it's highly significant to consider what you are depicting about your channel through these images.

 Hence, this being said or realized, selecting the appropriate banner resolution should be among your topmost priorities.

 The recommended banner dimensions of a YouTube video as suggested by YouTube are 2560 x 1440 pixels. But the dimensions may slightly vary with the variation in the devices being used by the users.
