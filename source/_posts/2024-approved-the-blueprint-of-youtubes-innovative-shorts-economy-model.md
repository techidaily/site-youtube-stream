* The best way of importing videos from YouTube is by using an innovative video converter like Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate. This program will help in downloading and converting files to a format that is supported by Adobe Premier.

#### Step 2: Editing

You can then modify the text, font, and the positioning as well. This page also allows you to set whether the text will crawl or roll.
