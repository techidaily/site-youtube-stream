A [watermark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark) is a still image that is usually plugged in the videos, for the purpose of claiming copyrights or publicity purpose. YouTube generally carries a ["branding"](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6147757?hl=en) option where you can brand your video with your channel. This doesn't provide a stable watermark. Therefore, when someone downloads that video using a second party (YouTube downloader) it gets removed. For this purpose the legal author will have to put a Channel watemark on their YouTube videos. In this guide, we will show you how to add watermark to your YouTube videos, existing or new.

### Notes

**YouTube watermark size**: Your watermark should be transparent, square, and larger than 50x50 pixels, which is the size it will be shrunk down to when it appears in the corner of your videos.

**YouTube watermark starting time**: you will have the option of choosing a start time for your watermark, making it appear only at the end of your video, or having it there for the entire length of your video. Once that is done click ‘Update’ and your watermark will be applied to your videos.

**YouTube watermark color**: Youtube suggests that your watermark have only one color. The point is that you should not use anything flashy that will take attention away from your video, so having two or three colors is not necessarily wrong if your design is subtle.

Here is a tutorial video for how to add watermark to Your YouTube videos:
