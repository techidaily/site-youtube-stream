There is so much content on YouTube that reaching millions of viewers can prove to be quite a challenge. The sheer amount of videos on YouTube pushes creators to upload videos that have a distinctive visual style to their channels. Adding an intro to a video you upload to YouTube can help you promote your channel, inform the audiences about new videos you’re planning to share online or briefly summarize the topic of a video. Creating an intro for a YouTube video is a time-consuming task that often requires advanced animation and video editing skills. In case you’re looking for a quick solution to this problem you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to reveal to you some of the best online destinations where you can find captivating YouTube intro templates that will make your videos stand out from the crowd.

## Top Online Platforms for Downloading YouTube Intro Templates

Video editing professionals use stock websites and online video editing platforms for a variety of reasons that range from obtaining complementary footage for their projects to discovering templates and other animation graphics. YouTube intro templates that are available on these websites are not compatible with all video editing, animation, motion graphics, and compositing software products. Here are some of the most reliable online sources that offer a wide variety of mesmerizing YouTube intro templates.

#### 1. [Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Filmstock_info](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Filmstock_info.png)

The Wondersahre’s stock footage platform offers a plethora of visual and audio effects, music, videos, and YouTube intro templates. In addition, Filmstock lets you choose from packs like Urban Opener, Dynamic Intro or Fast Pop that fit various visual styles of YouTube videos. You can use Filmostocks for free, but if you opt for this option you won’t have access to the media assets stored in the platform’s Standard Library. On the other hand, purchasing the Premium subscription plan enables you to download twenty premium assets per month and to discover new intros, effects or stock footage each day. Filmostocks is a great choice for all YouTubers who edit their videos with Filmora or other versions of this video editing software as well as Adobe After Effects.

MotionDen automates the video editing process which makes it a perfect choice for social media content creators.

Opting for a monthly subscription plan enables you to export all your videos in Full HD resolution and share them directly to YouTube.

#### 3. [Velosofy](https://www.velosofy.com/)

**Price:** Free

This is probably one of the largest video stock websites on the Internet right now that features video categories like Nature, People or Historical and Archival. The owners of the Basic subscription plan can’t download templates for Adobe After Effects since this option is only available within the Unlimited subscription plan. If you decide to become the full-time member of the Videoblocks community you’ll be able to download quick logo intros, glitch intros as well as a wide array of different templates you can add to videos you edit in After Effects.

Afterward, you just have to upload the media files you’d like your intro to contain. You won’t be able to use the platform’s template customization tools unless you are a registered subscriber. Videobolt is an excellent option for companies, entrepreneurs or anyone else who need an easy way to create visually impressive intros for the videos they upload to their YouTube channels.

#### 6. [Flixexpress](https://flixpress.com/AutomatedTemplates.aspx)

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $0.83 per month billed annually

**Compatibility:** web-based

Finding a perfect intro for your upcoming YouTube video won’t be much of a problem if you choose to become a member of the Flixexpress community, because the platform features thousands of automated templates that can be customized online. You must create an account on Flixexpress before you can start editing the templates, but keep in mind that the free version of the platform doesn’t allow you to import your own footage or store footage for longer than one day. Opting for any of the other available subscription plans will enable you to export your videos in 1080p resolution and have access to fifty or more templates, depending on the plan you choose.

**Conclusion**

Getting the attention of millions of viewers on YouTube is much easier if you start your videos with a captivating intro that sparks curiosity.

## How to choose the right video for your Slides?

Not all videos will make an impact on your Google Slide. You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.

**Be Professional** – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.

**Relevant** – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.

**Precise** – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.

**Know every footage you are working with** – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.

**Add new content** – even though one content may suit several presentations, don't rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.
