## Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags

Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.

If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.

This is a list that might help:

* #vloggingmylife
* #vlogginggear
* #vloggerlife
* #vloggers
* #vloglife
* #vlogger
* #vlogging
* #youtuber
* #vlogs
* #dailyvlog
* #vloggingcamera
* #vloging
* #vloggingcommunity
* #vloggerlifestyle
* #travelvlogging
* #vloggingmum
* #foodvlogging
* #vlogginglife
* #newtovlogging
* #disneyvlogging
* #vlogging101
* #vloggingsetup
* #vloggingfamily
* #vlogday
* #kidsvlogging
* #imvlogginghere
* #beautyvlogging
* #microvlogging
* #motovlogging
* #instavlogging

When using hashtags for YouTube, it's essential to put yourself in your viewers' shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.

For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.

This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.

## How to Edit YouTube Videos on Your Android Smartphone?

With the YouTube app, android users have an easy way to grab and upload videos to YouTube directly from their mobile devices.

In some instances, you may want to edit your videos on android devices. With the YouTube android app, editing videos is a simple task which involves the following process-:

Step 1: Click on YouTube and choose the small little icon indicating your profile. This will reveal to you all your videos on YouTube.

Step 2: Locate the video you want to edit then click on the three vertical little dots on the far right of the video to reveal for you more options. Choose on the “Edit” button drop-down menu.

Step 3: Once done with the editing, click on the small little icon (looks like a forward arrow) at the top of the screen to save your edits.
