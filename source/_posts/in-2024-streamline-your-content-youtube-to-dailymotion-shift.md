It is significant for a business to stay connected to its customers and videos are a wonderful medium to build that connect! Dailymotion gives you a golden opportunity and platform to share your videos on websites other than YouTube. This means that you can transfer your videos from YouTube to dailymotion in few minutes and increase the audience. There is no direct transfer feature in YouTube and hence this post will help in guiding how can you transfer the video content from YouTube to Dailymotion!

* [Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion](#part1)
* [Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion](#part2)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion

This one is little longer but many people vote for it as a safer one! All you have to do is to login to your YouTube official account and download all the videos that you have uploaded in MP4 format by clicking on Edit option appearing at right of the video.

Finally, just click on save to upload the video on dailymotion.

## Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion

The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.

Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video. This simply means that you need not upload any video separately on dailymotion, you can simply synch it with YouTube and put in your efforts of uploading only once!

## Hidden Treasures: Non-Top Films That Shine

There are many forms of temptation, but it's hard to resist when it's free online movie streaming or web series. Because of this, many people prefer to use famous free online streaming sites such as Fmovies in order to enjoy watching online movies without having to pay for them. Our search for alternatives begins when the site is overflowing with adverts and the design is no longer user pleasant. Because of FMovies unlimited content streaming, you may be annoyed by broken links and ads that interrupt your viewing experience. A solution has been found.

Today, we will discuss the greatest Fmovie Alternatives you should use in 2022.

## 7 Best Fmovie Alternatieves

We talk about the best Fmovie Alternatives. These are the following:

### 1.Crackle

Crackle has increased in popularity over the last several years and is a great alternative to FMovies for moviegoers. Sony owns the website, thus you have full access to Sony's whole library. In addition, the website's inventory is often updated, so you'll always find something fresh to watch.

Users may also search for such a film by genre, actor, and title on Crackle, making it easy to find what they're looking for quickly.

All users outside of the United States are restricted from using the platform since it is ad-supported and geo-blocked. A good adblocker can help you get rid of the adverts. However, the site's performance may suffer as a result. So, if you don't want to deal with ads, you may want to pay for a subscription.

Everyone should access the content they want legally, regardless of where they are. Crackle can be unblocked with a premium virtual private network if you're outside the United States.

There is no need to join Crackle to create a watch list. Users of Roku, Firestick/FireTV, iOS, and Android devices can access this website. It can also be accessed via the internet.

**Features:**

* Website's inventory is often updated
* Crackle can be unblocked with a premium virtual private network
