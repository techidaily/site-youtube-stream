<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you‚Äôre talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don‚Äôt like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it‚Äôs not the main focus of the video. It‚Äôs just there to make it better.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it‚Äôs easy to do.

### Editing

If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a **green screen background for YouTube videos**.

Just follow these steps and you‚Äôll have the perfect winter **background for YouTube** in no time.

##### Step 1

##### Step 4

Select your favorite background clip and drag it down to the Timeline.

That‚Äôs it! You won‚Äôt believe how many video clips you can use, all of which are extremely high-quality. As a result, you‚Äôll have a professional video for free.

Now, if you want, you can freely edit these backgrounds as you wish. You can mess around with them as much as you want, use various tools to edit, and make the perfect result.

And don‚Äôt worry, if you mess up the background and don‚Äôt know how to restore it, just delete it from the timeline and drag it again from the Stock Media tab. It will be as good as new.

Once you‚Äôre done, simply export it and you‚Äôre done.

## Integrating Your Background Into Videos

Finally, once you have the perfect YouTube studio background, it‚Äôs time to glue it to your video and upload this masterpiece.

In order to do this, you will need to use a video editing platform once again. This is not optional as there is no other way to merge these clips.

Luckily, you now have Filmora downloaded and can easily make it happen.

So, here‚Äôs how to combine everything.

##### Step 1

Start up a New Project in Filmora.

##### Step 2

Click on **‚Äú**My Media‚Äù and then click in the middle of the small box to upload your background and your video clips.

##### Step 3

After uploading all the files, simply drag everything in a separate Track down on the Timeline.

##### Step 4

Export and upload to YouTube. That‚Äôs it!
