## Extra Tip: Facebook Video Tips for more Views and Shares

You have to play your cards well when it comes to posting and sharing your videos on Facebook. These tips are all you need.

#### \- Catch viewer’s attention within the shortest time possible

Here, your main aim is to convince your viewers. So, don’t let them spend so much time before you catch their attention. You can bring up a point about some latest news or adventures that let your viewers connect immediately.

#### \- Add captions to the video

It is not necessarily possible that viewers will watch your videos with the sound on. Some like it when it’s silent and might disable the sound auto-play. Add some captions so that viewers will understand your video, even on silent mode.

#### \- Emphasize on one key-point

Focus on one key point so that your viewers are not swayed away. Your video is highly sharable if it is easy to understand.

#### \- Add a Call To Action

Including a call-to-action will encourage your viewers to subscribe to your channel. Ensure you include it at the end of your video to tell viewers what to do next. You could also include a link to your blog post to let your viewers read and find more content from your other channels.

#### \- Facebook ads can make a great difference

Facebook is a great place for running ads that reach a wider audience. Adverts are great ways to target a specific audience. They explain your products and services more straightforwardly.

#### \- Embed your videos on blog posts

Numerous people get to access guest posts and blog posts. You can embed your Facebook videos on such posts to reach more people. Just get the embed code from your video, then copy and paste it to a guest or blog post.

## Frequently Asked Question about Facebook video

Both viewers and content creators have a few concerns about YouTube and Facebook videos. Here are some frequently asked questions that will be of benefit to you.

#### 1) Is it legal to share YouTube videos?

YouTube is just one platform where content creators showcase their productions. Yes, it is legal to share your content on other forums like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.

#### 2) What is the best time to post to your Facebook page?

#### 3) What are Facebook business accounts and personal accounts?

Facebook business accounts are designed for users who want to use Facebook to administer their pages and advert campaigns. This account cannot be found in searching or receiving friend request apps. Nonetheless, personal accounts are used at basic and casual levels. You can search for friends and send requests. Personal accounts are also easy to manage.

#### 4) Can I mobilize people to share my posted content on Facebook?

SoapyEdits is a YouTuber with a [channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ-0Oq4zZj8hJkW1aXFzLr-x6WsjuGsW1) offering a whole playlist of PhotoShop PSD file end screen designs.

Here are some of our favorite ones.
