Even something as small as your **YouTube video thumbnail background** can strongly impact your results.

Obviously, choosing the right **custom YouTube background** is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.

## Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?

There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.

* Builds a better brand;
* Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

_This video will show you a preview of \[topic.\] If you're interested to learn more about this and what we do, please visit us at \[website link.\] You can also reach out to us at \[contact information.\]_

Please note that this is not the whole description. Rather, it is only the first 200 characters of it. As you can see, it's a CTA. It's wise to put it there because that part is what people would see the most. They'd have to click the "See More" button to read the rest of the description. And not everyone will click that.

**Tip:** Use URL shorteners if your website URL is too long. Remember that you only have 200 characters to use. So every character you can remove counts.
