## Why Should You Use Youtube as a News Source?

Many people use YouTube to watch funny viral videos and make-up lessons. However, a sizable portion of the American population relies on YouTube for news.

According to a recent Pew Research Center research, YouTube channels are an important source of news and information for more than a quarter of all individuals in the United States. While that's a lot of people turning to YouTube for news, it's not surprising given that the platform is the world's second most-trafficked search engine, directly behind its sister business Google. People use YouTube as a source of information, but they're seeking video rather than text.

#### What Are the Benefits of Youtube News?

What's more surprising is that conventional news media organizations don't account for nearly as much of what consumers consume. According to the report, half of the individuals who get their news via YouTube watch independent channels. And, of those who use YouTube to keep up with current events, 72 percent believe the platform is either an important or the most significant source of information for them. Independent media on YouTube frequently covers situations and topics that the mainstream media may overlook. It's also often complementing, allowing viewers to understand the concerns better.

![youtube news channel - the benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-news-channel-2.png)

According to the Pew study, 66 percent of those who watch YouTube videos for news feel it helps them better comprehend current events. Sixty-eight percent said the videos maintain their attention and that they normally watch them intently rather than playing them in the background. Not only that, but when YouTube news users were asked to explain in their own words why YouTube is a unique place to get news, the most common responses were related to the content itself, such as access to news sources outside of the mainstream and the diversity of opinions and viewpoints available on the platform.

So, the news channel is the quickest way to acquire any news, which an individual can view or listen to at any time via smartphones, laptops (via the internet), or radio.

The news channel has grown in popularity to disseminate or broadcast information to the rest of the world. The focus of television programming might shift. Some channels cover international or national issues, while others concentrate on weather, movie marketing, celebrity news, or sports.

Except for viewers under the age of 18, and a Breaking News shelf is shown on the YouTube homepage. The breaking news shelf on the YouTube homepage can be reached simply by scrolling down the YouTube homepage when a major news event occurs. If you're not interested, don't bother. The homepage's breaking news shelf can be turned off.

The information panel provides breaking news context in search results and will only offer text-based samples from a news story. In contrast, the content on the site will incorporate YouTube videos when they are available.

#### In search, the top News shelf

If you search for news, a Top News shelf appears in Search and has relevant information from news sources that follow Google News content policies. Regardless of age, the Top News shelf will appear.

## Why Should You Use Youtube as a News Source?

Many people use YouTube to watch funny viral videos and make-up lessons. However, a sizable portion of the American population relies on YouTube for news.

According to a recent Pew Research Center research, YouTube channels are an important source of news and information for more than a quarter of all individuals in the United States. While that's a lot of people turning to YouTube for news, it's not surprising given that the platform is the world's second most-trafficked search engine, directly behind its sister business Google. People use YouTube as a source of information, but they're seeking video rather than text.

#### What Are the Benefits of Youtube News?

What's more surprising is that conventional news media organizations don't account for nearly as much of what consumers consume. According to the report, half of the individuals who get their news via YouTube watch independent channels. And, of those who use YouTube to keep up with current events, 72 percent believe the platform is either an important or the most significant source of information for them. Independent media on YouTube frequently covers situations and topics that the mainstream media may overlook. It's also often complementing, allowing viewers to understand the concerns better.

![youtube news channel - the benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-news-channel-2.png)

According to the Pew study, 66 percent of those who watch YouTube videos for news feel it helps them better comprehend current events. Sixty-eight percent said the videos maintain their attention and that they normally watch them intently rather than playing them in the background. Not only that, but when YouTube news users were asked to explain in their own words why YouTube is a unique place to get news, the most common responses were related to the content itself, such as access to news sources outside of the mainstream and the diversity of opinions and viewpoints available on the platform.
