### Embedding a YouTube Playlist on a Website Using oEmbed Code

Another method to embed a YouTube playlist on your WordPress website is to use oEmbed Code. This method requires basic CSS, HTML, or Java knowledge; otherwise, you won't be able to customize your playlist.

Moreover, this method is too complicated for beginners, and you will miss the customer support provided by WordPress plugin developers in case of any mishaps.

To use the oEmbed Code method, do the following steps:

Step1 In the first step, head to your YouTube account and access the Playlist you want to embed. Next, click the three dots below it and copy its URL.

Step2 Now, login to your WordPress dashboard and open the post or page editor where you want to add the playlist.

Step3 Paste the URL directly in the editor and click **"Update"** to save the changes.

WordPress will grab your playlist from YouTube and automatically show it in your post using oEmbed. The outcome is a single video with a menu that your viewers can click to see other videos in the playlist.

### Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing <iframe >

Another way to embed a playlist of your YouTube channel on your WordPress site is by using the iFrame code with the following step-by-step instructions:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser on your desktop or laptop and go to your **YouTube channel.**

Step2 Now, head to the YouTube playlist you want to embed, click the **"Share"** icon, and a pop-up window will appear.

Step3 Choose the **"Embed"** option, and a new lightbox pop-up will appear, having your playlist's embed code. Click **"Copy"** to save the code on your clipboard.

Now, paste the iFrame embed code you've copied from YouTube and click "Update" at the top-right of the screen to save the changes and embed your playlist.

### Analyzing common monetization indicators

#### 1.Ads on Your Videos

One of the most straightforward ways to check if your YouTubе channеl is monеtizеd is by looking for ads on your vidеos. Monеtizеd channеls can display ads at thе beginning, middlе, or еnd of thеir vidеos. Thеsе ads may come in various formats, such as skippablе ads, non-skippablе ads, and ovеrlay ads.

To check for ads on your vidеos, watch some of your own content. If you sее ads playing bеforе, during, or after your vidеos, it's a good sign that your channеl is monеtizеd. Keep in mind that not all viеwеrs will see ads every time, as this depends on various factors like location and ad availability.

#### 2\. Sponsorships and Paid Promotions

Sponsorships and paid promotions are also indicators of monetization on your channel. Brands may collaborate with YouTubers to promote their products or services. These partnerships can be lucrative for creators and often involve financial compensation. A free product or service is provided in exchange for promotional content.

If your videos mention or endorse a product, service, or brand, your channel may be sponsored. Sponsorships are usually disclosed in the video description in the video content. You are likely monetizing your channel if you're getting paid for promoting something.

#### 3\. Merchandise Links in Descriptions

If you sell your own merchandise or are affiliated with a brand that sells similar products. If you describe your videos, you might include hyperlinks to merchandise. Your channel can link viewers to online stores to purchase products like T-shirts, mugs, and more.

Check your video descriptions for any merchandise links. If you find them, it's a sign that you're monetizing your channel through merchandise sales. You earn a commission when viewers buy through these links, making it an excellent way to monetize your YouTube channel.

#### 4\. Channel Memberships

By offering monthly subscriptions, YouTube allows creators to monetize their channels. You can invite subscribers to join your channel as members. They'll get members-only content, custom badges, emojis, and more. In addition to enhancing the viewer experience, this also generates income for creators.
