# How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog

A common problem for new YouTubers and Vlogers is that they cannot get through a recording without feeling like they have messed up and need to restart. It can be extremely discouraging at first. More experienced vloggers know that mistakes happen and they are no reason to stop recording. Instead of trying to record a perfect clip it is common for vloggers to remove errors from their videos in editing using jump cuts.

## How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog

#### 1\. What is a Jump Cut?

A jump cut is when you jump from one part of your clip to a later part of that same clip, cutting out the section in-between.

In movies or tv shows jump cuts can be distracting. In vlogs it is the exact opposite; jump cuts are used to remove distractions. It is not strange for a YouTube video to contain a lot of jump cuts. If you go and re-watch a video by your favorite vlogger you will probably notice that every once in a while the vlogger is suddenly sitting differently or that something else has suddenly changed. That is a jump cut, and chances are you did not even think twice about it when you first watched the video.

#### 2\. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video

There are a lot of things you might want to take out of your clips using jump cuts. Here are some examples:

**Repetition**: You may have had to repeat yourself because you misspoke. Or, you might watch your clip back and realize that two sections you intended – perhaps even scripted – are very similar and you only need one.

**Off-Topic Tangents**: Once you get comfortable talking to the camera it is easy to find yourself getting off-topic while recording. These tangents might be funny or feel important, but you should still cut them out of your final video. Rather than scrapping them completely, though, consider giving your tangent its very own video. Successful vloggers post new videos frequently, after all.

**Silence**: Use jump cuts to take out any pauses in your video. Every period of silence is an opportunity for viewers to get distracted and decide to click on something else. Adding music to the background of your video can help with shorter pauses, but cutting out any silence is still a good way to go.

In the video tutorial below, we will share with you some practical and creative jump cuts tips that you can try in video editing. And most of the jump cuts are done with the cutting features in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can download the free trial version below by clicking the Free Download button based on your system.

#### 3\. How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog & YouTube Videos

You can make jump cuts in almost every editing program, from free software like Windows Movie Maker to professional programs like Adobe Premiere. Remember no matter which video editing software you are using to edit your videos with jump cut, you need to ensure that the software can scroll through your video clips and audio files frame-by-frame. And some video editors may only allow you to scroll video footage frame by frame. This tutorial is for Filmora Video Editor (Now upgraded to Filmora), but many of the same steps will apply to other software.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

You may also like: [How to trim and cut videos in Windows Movie Maker for Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Open up Filmora Video Editor and add a clip into the timeline. Watch it through, and then revisit sections where you think you might want to make cuts.

Find a place in your clip that has silence and use the scissors icon to cut your clip into two. Then start playing your clip and pause as soon as you hear sound.

Make sure your clip is selected, and then go back frame by frame until you hear nothing.

Use the scissors icon to make another cut. You will now have three clips; one before the silence, the silent pause, and the section where sound starts again. Delete the quiet middle clip.

#### 4\. Keep video shorter for more views

The videos that get the most views on YouTube are an average of three minutes long. People will use the length of a video as a reason not to click on it. Viewers are also more likely to get distracted and stop watching longer videos before they are over. That does not mean you should not take as long as you need to properly explain your ideas, just that you should be careful your video is not longer than it needs to be. It is common for youtubers to use only about a third of the clip they record. The rest is removed using jump cuts.

## Rhythmic Repository: Perfect DJ Templates, Instantly Downloadable

Most think music is the most important thing in a professional DJ set. It might be the most important, but it’s not the only important element. The visuals are also essential. There are several reasons why the right DJ template video download can significantly improve your set.

Read below and you’ll open your eyes to how a simple template and a bit of video editing can change your whole career as a DJ.

**YouTube Video Background** Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.

## What Is a DJ Template Video Download?

DJ template video downloads are basically video templates with pre-recorded clips and effect presets that sync with your music. So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.

There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:

* **Pre-Designed Visuals:** These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.
* **Customizable Elements:** You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event's theme.
* **Format and Compatibility:** They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.

## Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?

Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.

With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.

After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone. You can do the same for live events as well as for your pre-recorded DJ sets.

## How to Customize Templates for a Unique Experience?

The way you customize these templates is by editing them in a video editor of your choice after downloading them. However, not all templates are customizable.

In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.

This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.

You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.

## Technical Considerations

Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.

So, consider the following:

##### 1\. Video Resolution and Quality

Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.

Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.

##### 2\. Format Compatibility

Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.

Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.

##### 3\. Performance and Playback

The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.

If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.

##### 4\. Audio Sync

Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.

You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.

## Legal Aspects and Copyright

This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.

Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:

## What Is a DJ Template Video Download?

DJ template video downloads are basically video templates with pre-recorded clips and effect presets that sync with your music. So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.

There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:

* **Pre-Designed Visuals:** These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.
* **Customizable Elements:** You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event's theme.
* **Format and Compatibility:** They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.

## Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?

Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.

With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.

After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone. You can do the same for live events as well as for your pre-recorded DJ sets.

## How to Customize Templates for a Unique Experience?

The way you customize these templates is by editing them in a video editor of your choice after downloading them. However, not all templates are customizable.

In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.

This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.

You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.

## Technical Considerations

Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.

So, consider the following:

##### 1\. Video Resolution and Quality

Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.

Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.

##### 2\. Format Compatibility

Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.

Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.

##### 3\. Performance and Playback

The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.

If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.

##### 4\. Audio Sync

Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.

You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.

## Legal Aspects and Copyright

This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.

Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:

* **Read the Fine Print**: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.
* **Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use**: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.
* **Attribution Requirements**: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.
* **Modifications and Derivative Works**: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.
