It is significant for a business to stay connected to its customers and videos are a wonderful medium to build that connect! Dailymotion gives you a golden opportunity and platform to share your videos on websites other than YouTube. This means that you can transfer your videos from YouTube to dailymotion in few minutes and increase the audience. There is no direct transfer feature in YouTube and hence this post will help in guiding how can you transfer the video content from YouTube to Dailymotion!

* [Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion](#part1)
* [Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion](#part2)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion

This one is little longer but many people vote for it as a safer one! All you have to do is to login to your YouTube official account and download all the videos that you have uploaded in MP4 format by clicking on Edit option appearing at right of the video.

Ready to learn [How to Download YouTube Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . It's easy, fun and a great way to share your movies with the world.

Save it to the desired folder on your PC and navigate to the Dailymotion account page. Sign in with your credentials and click on upload video. Browse the video from the location where you saved, give it a title and description.

![dailymotion-uploading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-uploading.jpg)

Next, click on channel drop-down menu and choose a category which best describes your video. Besides this, you would see a ‘Tags’ text box. You can add one or more tags (maximum 10) and select the privacy options as per your requirement. Tags act as a criterion for SEO optimization and help people in finding your video. Finally, just click on save to upload the video on dailymotion.

The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.

![ Sync Dailymotion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-dailymotion-video.jpg)

It will ask for your email address to get notifications, put in your email ID and click on Sync. Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video. This simply means that you need not upload any video separately on dailymotion, you can simply synch it with YouTube and put in your efforts of uploading only once!
