**Step 2:** Run the Filmora software and when a window appears on your screen, click on the new project and select the 16:9 aspect ratio of your project.

**Step 3:** Now first, you need to record your reaction to a [music video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use Filmora's Built-In screen recorder to record your reaction along with your cam. You can also record your reactions separately and then merge them with the original music video using Filmora.

**Step 4:** Now import the music video on which you want to react to the Filmora library along with your reaction video. You can do this by clicking on the file, import, and import media.

**Step 5:** Now drag the music video from the Library and drop it into the Filmora timeline.

**Step 6:** Now drag your reaction video and drop it above the original music video in the track.

**Step 7:** Decrease the size of your reaction video by using the canvas controls in the preview window and adjusting it to any side of the window.

**Step 8:** If you want to keep your reaction video in a big frame and your music video in a small one, you can do the opposite.

**Step 9:** If you want to add any effects or call-outs to your video, you can use the rich elements library of Filmora, where you can find hundreds of interactive elements.
