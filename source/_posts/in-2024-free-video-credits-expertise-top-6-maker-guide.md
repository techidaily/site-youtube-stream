Here are 6 outro maker sites where you can get outros and end cards. Check the bottom for our #1 pick!

> * [Outro Maker](#outromaker)
> * [Biteable](#biteable)
> * [Tube Arsenal](#tubearsenal)
> * [Renderforest](#renderforest)
> * [Panzoid](#Panzoid)
> * [Intro Cave](#introcave)
> * [The #1 Pick!](#one)
> * [Wondershare Filmora](#filmora)

## 6 YouTube Outro Makers With Templates

For even more End Screen Templates, [click here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-youtube-end-screen-templates%21-plus%3B-how-to-build-your-301.html).

#### 1. [Outro Maker](https://outromaker.com/blog/free-outro-templates-for-download)

**Overview:** _Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost._

On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.

Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.

#### 2. [Biteable](https://biteable.com/)

**Overview:** _Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free._

Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.

This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.

#### 3. [Tube Arsenal](https://tubearsenal.com/)

**Overview:** _Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10._

Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates/end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors/logo/images. They have template cards with slots for videos/playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.

Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).

#### 4. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Overview:** _Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros._

Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.

One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.

#### 5. [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

**Overview:** _Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text._

Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).

#### 6. [Intro Cave](https://introcave.com/)

**Overview:** _It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave._

As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.

Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.

## YouTube Outro Maker Alternative-[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

As the world has progressed, a great deal has changed, and it has transformed into a digital hub. People have started to use different platforms to entertain themselves, watch their favorite content online, gaming, music, sports, or any other form of entertainment.

Cross-platform streaming is a concept people have started to follow especially when it comes to gaming. The audience has a wide variety of choices when it comes to viewing live content online.

YouTube and Twitch are two major platforms streamers use to publish their content online for their targeted audience. They need to stream their content on YouTube and Twitch simultaneously as it engages a wider range of audiences worldwide, and newer streamers can benefit from it.

#### In this article

Part 1: [How Can You Stream on Twitch and YouTube at the Same Time?](#step1)

Part 2: [How to Multi-stream using Streamlabs Prime](#step2)

Part 3: [Bonus Tips | Enlarge your Live Stream Performance!](#step3)

## Part 1: How Can You Stream on Twitch and YouTube at the Same Time?

To stream simultaneously on multiple platforms, a certain program or application is required to provide you with the required tools to enable you to broadcast your content. Several programs provide the option to stream to multiple websites at the same time e.g., Restream, Streamlabs Prime, and MelonApp.

### Restream

Restream.io is a service that provides you with the option to broadcast your content to more than 30 different platforms including Twitch and YouTube. When you log in, you can choose the channels you wish to broadcast on and restream will issue a unique key for you.

![Restream](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-1.jpg)

After you have selected your desired selection, go to your broadcasting software, and choose Restream.io as your preferred service and insert your unique key provided by Restream.

Restream will let you use their services for free provided you use it with their watermark. It is recommended for newer users but if you wish to remove the watermark and go ad-free you will have to upgrade your plan.

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you stream using Restream.io

### Step 1: Sign up or log in

The first step is to sign up on Restream. It will require you to choose a unique username, password and enter a valid email address.

### Step 2: Choose your desired Platforms

From the list of different platforms, choose the ones you wish to stream to and add your channels by authorizing with the required credentials. Restream has an option of more than 30 platforms including YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

![Choose your desired Platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Choose your subscription plan

Choose your desired plan that caters to your needs. Keep in mind that Restream is 100% free but free accounts do not come with recording or storage and will show a Restream watermark.

![Choose your subscription plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-3.jpg)

You can remove this watermark by upgrading your subscription plan to a Professional one from the dashboard.

### Step 4: Choose the final streaming platforms

Connect all your channels so you can stream from a single platform. Click the platform icon and connect your preferred accounts with Restream.

### Step 5: Tweak the settings according to your preference

Restream also offers a wide range of services including the option to stream pre-recorded videos on Twitch at a preselected time and date. However, there is a caveat that you will not be able to multi-stream after you get an affiliate status on your Twitch channel.

## Part 2: How to Multi-stream using Streamlabs Prime

Streamlabs Prime is the premium version of Streamlabs. It provides you with a range of 40+ apps that can also improve the quality of your streams and allow you to multi-stream. It is one of the best streaming software in the game currently.

Many content creators use Streamlabs to simultaneously run their streams on YouTube along with Twitch to grasp a wider range of audiences and get more views. One of the best things about Streamlabs is that you can connect to the broadcast services directly from the program without entering any stream key.

Streamlabs has included the option to Multi Stream on different platforms within its OBS client. Below are the steps required to set you up for streaming on YouTube and Twitch at the same time.

### Step 1: Open the settings of your desired client
