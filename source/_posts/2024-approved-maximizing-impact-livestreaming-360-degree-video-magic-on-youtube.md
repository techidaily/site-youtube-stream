 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Emojis are a great way to make your videos and comments stand out from the rest. You may also be able to catch the attention of millennials and improve your YouTube and Google ranking. Beginners can use emojis as a great strategy to improve YouTube SEO performance and get ahead of others. Experts suggest using emojis wisely; that is not to overload or spam whole titles or comments with smileys!

Here are some great ways to add YouTube comments emojis:

## Part 1: How to Type Emojis in a YouTube Comment on Windows

Here are several ways to type emojis in YouTube comments. Follow the instructions below to write YouTube comments with emojis:

### 1\. Adding Emojis to YouTube Videos on Windows with Keyboard

![Add Emojis to YouTube comments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emojis-to-youtube-comments.jpg)

If you are using Windows 10, then you can use the keyboard shortcut to open the emoji icons. Press Windows + ; (semi-colon) or Windows + . (period) to open the emoji keyboard. And you will see the emojis.

Currently, there are 6 types of emojis you can add on Windows, including smiley faces and animals, people, celebrities and objects, foods and plants, transportation and places, and symbols.

You can then click the emoji that you’d like to add to the YouTube video directly.

### 2\. Copy and Paste Emojis from Websites
