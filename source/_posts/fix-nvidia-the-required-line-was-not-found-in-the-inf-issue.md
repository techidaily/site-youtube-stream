 It could be frustrating if you can’t install NVIDIA Graphics driver due to error “The required line was not found in the INF”. To resolve the error, use the methods below.

 You can manually uninstall the driver:  

 1) On your keyboard, press **Win+R** (Windows key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.  

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click the **OK** button. This is to open Device Manager.

5) Restart your PC as soon as possible.

6) After restarting your PC, reinstall the driver and check to see if you can install it successfully.  
  
 If the error continues, follow below steps to manually install the driver via Device Manager. To do this, you must have NVIDIA installer stored in your computer.
  
 1) Extract the installer file. (The downloaded installer file usually is in .exe format or .zip format.)  
  
 2) Open Device Manager again.  
  
 3) Right-click on NVIDIA graphics card and select **Update Driver Software…**

 8) Windows will look for**.inf** files in the folder to install the driver. After selecting the .inf file, click the **Open** button. Then follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If you can’t even find.inf files, the driver pack is not available, you can’t install the driver manually. In this case, skip and move to Method 2.

## Method 2: Install the driver using Driver Easy

 If Method 1 doesn’t work for you, or if you can’t install the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to a flagged Nvidia driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
