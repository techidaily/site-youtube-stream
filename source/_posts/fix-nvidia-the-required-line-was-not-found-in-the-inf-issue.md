 If the error continues, follow below steps to manually install the driver via Device Manager. To do this, you must have NVIDIA installer stored in your computer.

 8) Windows will look for**.inf** files in the folder to install the driver. After selecting the .inf file, click the **Open** button. Then follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If you can’t even find.inf files, the driver pack is not available, you can’t install the driver manually. In this case, skip and move to Method 2.

## Method 2: Install the driver using Driver Easy

 If Method 1 doesn’t work for you, or if you can’t install the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 3) Click the **Update** button next to a flagged Nvidia driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
