## Part 1: What is YouTube MCN (multi-channel network)

If you are curious to learn more about what exactly MCN in YouTube is all about, then here it is. Sometimes multiple YouTube channels collaborate to form a network and they rigorously work together to gain more exposure and revenues.

They share various tools and assist each other in channel management and charge a specific percentage of the revenue generated out of the partner channels. They promote each other through the network and split the generated revenue.

In most cases it is a win-win deal for both the YouTube channels, as their popularity and reach is enhanced due to the network. The ultimate goal of these MCNs is to grow the audience base, enhance earnings and support/assist each other to flourish together.

## Part 2: What can I get from joining MCN YouTube network?

The offerings from MCN YouTube are aplenty. When everything is managed properly, the profits increase and you get better exposure beyond your usual audience. But, care must be taken while choosing the network you want to join and collaborate with. Here are the things that you can expect from a successful MCN collaboration.

### 1\. Broad market

Growing from the scratch and reaching a wide audience in YouTube is usually tough as it involves lots of effort and time. Content distribution is the key to get more publicity among the potential consumers. Forums, social media, and websites are different ways for content sharing but it is a rough path when travelled alone. With MCN YouTube, you will get a dedicated team to help you out in this regard.

Your business will stand out when your personal branding is strong enough. With YouTube MCN you can easily build your brand and market the content to a larger viewer base.

### 2\. Digital rights protection

The functioning of a YouTube MCN is not only restricted to revenue generation or brand promotion. They also take care of your channel, when you face copyright strikes that otherwise results in losing money and other advanced YouTube features. The MCN handles the copyright management issues, while you concentrate on creating engaging and valuable content.

### 3\. Collaborations with other YouTubers

These MCNs allow you to collaborate with other YouTube channels and enhance your business exposure. In such a case you getter better foothold in the YouTube network, as other YouTubers in your network share the videos within the community and allow it to get more views. When such a larger audience is consuming your content, there are higher chances of getting the best out of MCN.

### 4\. Better video production facilities

When you are a beginner, you mostly run with a limited resource in terms of budget and equipment. These MCNs ensure that you get the tools and technology like studio equipment to create and edit videos. Top-notch post-production tools are also available with them to boost your channel’s videos.

### 1\. Split revenue

Although, YouTube clearly doesn’t mention the revenue you will generate from your YouTube channel under the YouTube partner agreement. Your channel and YouTube respectively share 55/45 revenue. When you take help from your MCN the 55% earnings will further deteriorate after paying a percentage of your AdSense revenue to them.

### 2\. Outcome is not always exciting

If you are thinking that the viewership will jump up multi-fold after involving a MCN, then you need to hold on and rethink. It is not guaranteed that a MCN will always end up giving you more view and subscribers to your channel, though it happens with some people.

Go through what you will be gaining from the YouTube MCN in terms of promoting your videos, promotional offers and increasing the subscriber as well as boosting your channel’s exposure.

Any MCN won’t guarantee you for achieving a specific number of subscribers or views if you join them. It’s important to work out what is important for us and for what reasons you are teaming up with that MCN.

In case there is no ROI for you with a YouTube MCN then it’s better to be on your own and try hard to enhance the reach and revenue. Without an ROI, it is futile to sacrifice your earnings in vain.

## The bottom line

If you are asking us that you should join a YouTube MCN, then we would recommend you that the decision lies with you. As a YouTube channel owner and content creator, you have a certain goal to achieve.

So, it’s you who needs to figure out the important steps to be taken for attaining all the short and long term goals. Weigh your options and then opt for MCNs, if their assistance and service are close to meeting your expectations with your YouTube channel.

To decide whether to go for a YouTube network partnership or not, first check what percentage of your revenue they will be charging. It’s a key constraint for deciding about the viability of the partnership. If after calculating the proposed revenue sharing you have substantial profits, then going with the MCN is worth it.

The next point is the term of the contract. Never go for contracts that stretch for a longer duration. Put more stress on the legal contracts with the help of a professional lawyer. You need to be very careful about rights, termination of contracts and the likes. Though, we won’t be elaborately explaining the legal decisions involved in officially joining any YouTube network.

### 1\. Broad market

Growing from the scratch and reaching a wide audience in YouTube is usually tough as it involves lots of effort and time. Content distribution is the key to get more publicity among the potential consumers. Forums, social media, and websites are different ways for content sharing but it is a rough path when travelled alone. With MCN YouTube, you will get a dedicated team to help you out in this regard.

Your business will stand out when your personal branding is strong enough. With YouTube MCN you can easily build your brand and market the content to a larger viewer base.

### 2\. Digital rights protection

The functioning of a YouTube MCN is not only restricted to revenue generation or brand promotion. They also take care of your channel, when you face copyright strikes that otherwise results in losing money and other advanced YouTube features. The MCN handles the copyright management issues, while you concentrate on creating engaging and valuable content.

![digital rights protectation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/digital-rights-protectation.JPG)

### 3\. Collaborations with other YouTubers

These MCNs allow you to collaborate with other YouTube channels and enhance your business exposure. In such a case you getter better foothold in the YouTube network, as other YouTubers in your network share the videos within the community and allow it to get more views. When such a larger audience is consuming your content, there are higher chances of getting the best out of MCN.

### 4\. Better video production facilities

When you are a beginner, you mostly run with a limited resource in terms of budget and equipment. These MCNs ensure that you get the tools and technology like studio equipment to create and edit videos. Top-notch post-production tools are also available with them to boost your channel’s videos.

## Part 3: Cons of joining MCN YouTube network

You should never ignore the downside of every step you take while grooming your YouTube channel to touch the heights of success. Here are few of the prominent drawbacks of joining any MCN YouTube network.

### 1\. Split revenue

Although, YouTube clearly doesn’t mention the revenue you will generate from your YouTube channel under the YouTube partner agreement. Your channel and YouTube respectively share 55/45 revenue. When you take help from your MCN the 55% earnings will further deteriorate after paying a percentage of your AdSense revenue to them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Outcome is not always exciting

If you are thinking that the viewership will jump up multi-fold after involving a MCN, then you need to hold on and rethink. It is not guaranteed that a MCN will always end up giving you more view and subscribers to your channel, though it happens with some people.

Go through what you will be gaining from the YouTube MCN in terms of promoting your videos, promotional offers and increasing the subscriber as well as boosting your channel’s exposure.

Any MCN won’t guarantee you for achieving a specific number of subscribers or views if you join them. It’s important to work out what is important for us and for what reasons you are teaming up with that MCN.

In case there is no ROI for you with a YouTube MCN then it’s better to be on your own and try hard to enhance the reach and revenue. Without an ROI, it is futile to sacrifice your earnings in vain.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## The bottom line

If you are asking us that you should join a YouTube MCN, then we would recommend you that the decision lies with you. As a YouTube channel owner and content creator, you have a certain goal to achieve.

So, it’s you who needs to figure out the important steps to be taken for attaining all the short and long term goals. Weigh your options and then opt for MCNs, if their assistance and service are close to meeting your expectations with your YouTube channel.

To decide whether to go for a YouTube network partnership or not, first check what percentage of your revenue they will be charging. It’s a key constraint for deciding about the viability of the partnership. If after calculating the proposed revenue sharing you have substantial profits, then going with the MCN is worth it.

The next point is the term of the contract. Never go for contracts that stretch for a longer duration. Put more stress on the legal contracts with the help of a professional lawyer. You need to be very careful about rights, termination of contracts and the likes. Though, we won’t be elaborately explaining the legal decisions involved in officially joining any YouTube network.

## YouTube Enhancement: The Art of Background Blur

# How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

A lot of YouTubers like to vlog in front of blurred backgrounds. [Blurring the background of your YouTube video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a fast way to make it look more professional – you stand out when you are entirely in focus, and everything behind you is blurry. Plus, it is an easy way to disguise the room you are vlogging from.

Even if your set is clean, there could be things like books behind you, which will distract viewers; they will be trying to read the spines. Blurring out the background of your shot makes your video look polished and keeps people's focus entirely on you.

* [Part 1: Blur YouTube Video Background in Shooting Videos](#blur%5Fbackground%5Fin%5Fvideo%5Fshooting)
* [Part 2: Add Tilt-Shift Effects to Video in Editing](#blur%5Fbackground%5Fin%5Fvideo%5Fediting)

## Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos

Blurring your background is also how you create a beautiful bokeh lighting effect. Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.

 **Aperture** refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.

 **Depth of Field** is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.

 **F-Stops** are the measurement of an aperture's width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f/1.4'. You need an f-stop of less than f/4 to blur your background, and less than f/2.8 for bokeh.

#### 1\. Blurring and Bokeh

Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.  
To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.

#### 2\. How to Blur your Background

Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.

If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.

To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f/3 or f/4 can also work.

Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject/depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.

## Blur Video Background in Post-Production with [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production. Here, I will show you how to do that in Filmora.

Filmora is one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers. Its user-friendly interface and tutorial guide enables green-hands to start video editing quickly. Besides, you can find many free filters, effects, and elements pre-programmed, so you can use them directly without looking for presets and templates somewhere else.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Add Bokeh Filter to Video in Filmora

There are about 20 bokeh effects available in filters and overlays. You can find them easily by typing bokeh in the search bar in Effects.

Note: you should select **Included** to see all bokeh effects pre-programmed in Filmora. If you need more visual effects, just go to [the Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effects store.

![ Filmora Bokeh effect ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-bokeh-effect.jpg)

Double click the bokeh effect to preview the result, and if you find the bokeh effect fits the video, just drop it to the track above the video. And the bokeh filter or overlay will be applied to the video automatically.

### 2\. Use Tilt-Shift Circle/Linear Effect to Blur Video Background

Filmora features two tilt effects, tilt-shift circle and tilt-shift linear, which allows you to highlight people in the video, blur, and conceal the video background.

Go to the **Effects** tab and then switch to the **Utility** menu under **Included** category.

![ Filmora Tilt-Shift effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tilt-shift-effects.jpg)

Here, I will select the **Tilt-Shift Circle** effect and drop it to the track above the video. Now, you can adjust the size, position, and intensity of the tilt-shift circle effect

![ Filmora Tilt-Shift Circle effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-tilt-shift-circle-effect.jpg)

You see, the video background is blurred, and the people are highlighted. Now it's your turn to download the Filmora video editor and try it yourself.

A lot of YouTubers like to vlog in front of blurred backgrounds. [Blurring the background of your YouTube video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a fast way to make it look more professional – you stand out when you are entirely in focus, and everything behind you is blurry. Plus, it is an easy way to disguise the room you are vlogging from.

Even if your set is clean, there could be things like books behind you, which will distract viewers; they will be trying to read the spines. Blurring out the background of your shot makes your video look polished and keeps people's focus entirely on you.

## Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos

Blurring your background is also how you create a beautiful bokeh lighting effect. Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.

 **Aperture** refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.

 **Depth of Field** is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.

 **F-Stops** are the measurement of an aperture's width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f/1.4'. You need an f-stop of less than f/4 to blur your background, and less than f/2.8 for bokeh.

#### 1\. Blurring and Bokeh

Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.  
To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.

#### 2\. How to Blur your Background

Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.

If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.

To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f/3 or f/4 can also work.

Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject/depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.

## Blur Video Background in Post-Production with [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production. Here, I will show you how to do that in Filmora.

Filmora is one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers. Its user-friendly interface and tutorial guide enables green-hands to start video editing quickly. Besides, you can find many free filters, effects, and elements pre-programmed, so you can use them directly without looking for presets and templates somewhere else.

### 1\. Add Bokeh Filter to Video in Filmora

There are about 20 bokeh effects available in filters and overlays. You can find them easily by typing bokeh in the search bar in Effects.

Note: you should select **Included** to see all bokeh effects pre-programmed in Filmora. If you need more visual effects, just go to [the Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effects store.

### 2\. Use Tilt-Shift Circle/Linear Effect to Blur Video Background

Filmora features two tilt effects, tilt-shift circle and tilt-shift linear, which allows you to highlight people in the video, blur, and conceal the video background.

Go to the **Effects** tab and then switch to the **Utility** menu under **Included** category.
