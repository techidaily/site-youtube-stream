# How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails

The art on your [YouTube channel](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) – banners, thumbnails, icons, and watermarks – will help to determine how viewers feel about your vlog. If your art does not look like it all goes together then people will get a sloppy, amateurish, impression of your channel. However, if your different pieces of channel art all seem to complement each other and match the tone and theme of your channel then it will help viewers to have a pleasant browsing experience. They will get the impression that you take your YouTube channel seriously and that they can trust you as a source of information, comedy, or general entertainment.

## How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails

YouTube Banners and Thumbnails are two of the most important pieces of channel art you will need. This article will explain the best practices for both, and suggest sites where you will be able to build your own banners and thumbnails for free.

#### 1\. YouTube Banners

**Quick Tips:**

1. The image you upload for your YouTube banner should be 2560 x 1440px (pixels).
2. The 'safe area' for text, logos, and other important visual information (like faces) is 1546 x 423px.

Your banner is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think about channel art. Banners are the headers that rest at the tops of channel pages on YouTube. Your banner should be 2560 x 1440 px, although not all of it will always be visible. On a desktop computer or mobile device only a 1546 x 423 px ‘safe area’ will be visible. When viewed on a TV screen your entire image will be visible. YouTube does support PNG, but if your PNG file does not upload properly (as has been the case for some YouTubers) then changing your file type to JPEG might help.

YouTube Banners are extremely important to the success of your channel. If you do not have a banner then it looks like you do not really care about your vlog. If you have a basic banner that is not at all personalized then it certainly looks like you care, but it might also look like you are new to YouTube.

The best banners are customized to reflect the kind of experience you want viewers to have on your channel. The banner of a comedic YouTube channel might use bright colors, where the banner for a gaming channel will probably use darker colors similar to the ones that are in the games the vlogger plays. Connecting your banner to the theme of your channel is part of how you define the style of your vlog. It is the difference between being a Beauty Guru and a general YouTuber who gives makeup tips sometimes.

Including a photo of yourself, or your logo if you have one, is a great way to personalize your banner.

#### 2\. YouTube Thumbnails

**Quick Tips:**

1. Search for your video's topic to see the thumbnails your thumbnail will be competing against.
2. Make any text huge so people can read it on their smartphone screens.
3. Emojis, colored boarders, and graphics are all potential ways to stand out.

Thumbnails are often ignored by newer YouTubers. YouTube selects a thumbnail for every one of your videos and it is always a still image from that video. You can choose which frame you want to use and a lot of people feel like that is good enough. When you create a custom thumbnail, however, you get to not only choose your image but insert a title.

If you are choosing the images you are using for thumbnails you can make sure they are always similar frames. This will help people identify your videos quickly in searches. Using titles in your thumbnails will also help searchers identify your videos, if you always use the same title style. Another benefit of titles is that they capture the attention of people looking for your specific topic. Remember when building your thumbnails that they will appear smaller on YouTube than they probably are while you edit them. On mobile devices, they will look even smaller. So, if you are going to use text in your thumbnail, make sure it is huge.

One thumbnail taboo that you should never break is using an image that has nothing to do with your video. Using an image of a cute cat for a vlog post that has nothing to do with cats is misleading and will anger viewers. You may draw in a lot of viewers who want to see a cat video, but they will leave right away when they do not see a cat and they will never watch anything by you again.

#### 3.Where To Create Banners and Thumbnails

There are sites online that will allow you to edit images and use them in templates for YouTube banners. You can also use these services to edit your thumbnails. Two of the most popular, free, online photo editors are PicMonkey.com and Canva.com.

![banner n thumb Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/banner-n-thumb-Canva.JPG)

**Canva** has templates you can use to create YouTube banners, as well as a variety of stock images you can use in combination with your own when creating channel art. It is free to edit images on Canva, but they do have some premium features which cost $1 each to access. This service has both a desktop version and an iPad app.

![banner n thumb PicMonkey](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/banner-n-thumb-PicMonkey.JPG)

**PicMonkey** lets you import images from your computer or social media accounts, edit them, and use them in templates for YouTube banners or other kinds of social media graphics. PicMonkey is free to use, but you can only access their more advanced editing tools if you buy a paid subscription. Monthly subscriptions are $4.99 per month, and yearly subscriptions are $2.75 per month.

The world’s largest video sharing platform currently has nearly two billion active monthly users who upload over 400 hours of video content to their channels each minute. It is to see from these statistics why every video aspiring YouTubers post on their channels has to be perfect in every way in order to reach a wide audience. Fortunately, trimming a video even after you’ve uploaded it to YouTube is a quick and easy process, and in this article, we are going to show you a few different methods you can use to trim the videos you upload to YouTube. So, let’s get started.

## How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?

The **YouTube Studio** is no longer in beta phase, which means that the feature is here to stay. This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.

Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your **profile picture** and select the **YouTube Studio (Beta)** option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like **Analytics, Dashboard or Videos**, so just click on the **Videos** option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the **Editor** option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.

![Trim YouTube videos after uploading ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-editor-youtube-studio.jpg)

Click on the **Trim button** to start trimming the video and drag the **blue bars** located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video you’d like to remove. Preview the changes and confirm what you’ve made by clicking on the **Save** button located in the upper right corner of the screen and the new shortened version of the video will become available within a couple of hours.

![ YouTube Studio - Trim YouTube videos after uploading ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-save-video-trimming-youtube-studio.jpg)

In this way, you don’t need to take down the original video, edit it and re-upload. One of the benefits of trimming YouTube videos with the Trim feature in YouTube Editor is that this will keep your video URL and views and ranks etc.

## Trimming a Video Before Posting On YouTube with [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \[4 Ways\]

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### Method 1: Trim on Timeline

YouTubers who don’t want to rely on YouTube’s video editing capabilities can trim their footage with Filmora (to be honest, the Editor in YouTube platform has limited features). Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the **Import** drop-down menu and select the **Import Media Files** option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the **Media tab**, and you can just **drag and drop** it to a video track on the timeline.

All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag **one of its ends to the left or to the right**. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display **the remaining footage** while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to **extend the file by dragging it** until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.

![Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif)

#### Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool

Filmora’s **Split tool** can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply **place the playhead** at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make **a cut**, and click on the **Split icon** that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the **Delete** button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.

#### Method 3: Using Scene Detection

Wondershare’s video editor also offers an **automatic way to split a video** clip into a number of separate scenes. **Right-click** on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the **Scene Detection** option from the menu and proceed to click on the **Detect button**, after the **Scene Detection window** pops up on the screen. The software will then **automatically analyze the footage** and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the **Add to Timeline button** once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.

#### Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool

The **Instant Cutter Tool** enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the **Import with Instant Cutter Tool option** from the **Import drop-down menu** and wait for the **Filmora Instant Cutter** window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see **Trim and Merge tabs**. Make sure that the **Trim tab** is selected and then click on the **Open File button** to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use **the trimming sliders** to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the **In and Out points** by clicking on the **Set In Point or Set Out Point icons**. Click on the **Export button** to save the new version of the video clip and **click OK** to complete the process.

## Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos

In case you’re looking for a tool that lets you save extracts of scenes from YouTube to your computer free of charge [YT Cutter](https://ytcutter.com/) may be one of your best options.

![Trim YouTube Videos online ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yt-cutter-youtube-trimmer.jpg)

This online video editing platform is remarkably easy to use since you just have to **copy** **the link to the YouTube video** you’d like to trim into **YT Cutter’s URL box** and then select how long the new video should be. Click on the **Start and End buttons** to set the duration of the video and click on the **Download button** to choose if you want to create **a video, GIF or an audio file**. The trimmed YouTube video will be available for download as soon as the platform processes it, and you just need to specify a folder on your hard drive before clicking on **the Save button**.
