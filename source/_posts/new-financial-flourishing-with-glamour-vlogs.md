There are a lot of ways you can make money by posting makeup, beauty, or fashion videos on YouTube. These are all industries that understand the value of quality social media content.

 In the video above, [beauty YouTuber](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Gena M explains all the ways there are to make money posting makeup and fashion videos on YouTube. Gena’s most important piece of advice for other beauty vloggers is, to be honest. There is nothing wrong with making money from affiliates or sponsors, so long as you only associate with and recommend products you would actually buy.

Here’s more advice on how you can make money from your makeup videos:

## Sponsorships

If you are truly passionate about makeup or fashion then you probably have a few favorite brands. Even if you have never really thought about a brand as your favorite, chances are you purchase one or two types of lip gloss – or any other product – over others on a regular basis.

Wouldn’t it be nice if a company whose product you already love and use in your videos would start paying you just to mention them?

There are sites called influencer marketing platforms – the most popular one is FameBit – where you can find brands that are looking for creators just like you to work with them on marketing campaigns. Brands post what they are looking for, and you send them proposals for what kinds of videos you want to make for them.

Sometimes, creating branded content can be as easy as drawing attention to the brand of the eyeliner you use in a few of your tutorials.

Other times, brands may want you to say specific things or include logos in your videos.

Make sure to incorporate any brand messages or product placement you agree to do in ways that will feel natural to your viewers. You should let them know that you have a sponsor, and then incorporate the branded content in ways that do not take away from their enjoyment of your videos.

## Ad Revenue

Monetizing your videos and earning ad revenue is one of the primary ways beauty vloggers, and all other YouTubers, make money. It takes a long time to earn more than the pocket change from ads, but so long as you keep growing your audience your revenue will keep going up.

Pay attention to the estimated revenue reports to see which of your videos are earning the most money from ads (they won’t always be your most popular videos). By making more videos on similar topics you will be able to make more money.

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135418/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Affiliate Links

By becoming an Amazon affiliate, or joining the affiliate program of another online store, you can make money by including links to products in the descriptions of your video or in your related blog posts.

For example, if you talk about your new curling iron in a hair tutorial then you can include a special link to it on Amazon. If any of your viewers follow that link and buy it, you earn a percentage of the purchase.

Even better – if that person keeps shopping, or even skips the curling iron and buys something else, you earn a percentage of any purchase they make on Amazon for a certain period of time.

Affiliate links are mostly used by bloggers, not YouTubers, but you can still include them in the descriptions of your videos (not YouTube Cards or annotations though). It is not a bad idea for you to create blog posts to accompany your videos and post your affiliate links. Blogs are a great way to generate traffic to your videos.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Gifts

Sometimes companies might just give you stuff.

As your following gets bigger, brands might start sending you samples of their products in the hopes that you will fall in love with them and mention, review, or use them in your videos. This is not the same as a sponsorship because the brand is not paying you for a specific kind of message.

Receiving these kinds of gifts is not the same as getting paid, but it can certainly save you money on makeup.

## 7 Best Fmovie Alternatieves

We talk about the best Fmovie Alternatives. These are the following:

### 1.Crackle

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Crackle has increased in popularity over the last several years and is a great alternative to FMovies for moviegoers. Sony owns the website, thus you have full access to Sony's whole library. In addition, the website's inventory is often updated, so you'll always find something fresh to watch.

Users may also search for such a film by genre, actor, and title on Crackle, making it easy to find what they're looking for quickly.

All users outside of the United States are restricted from using the platform since it is ad-supported and geo-blocked. A good adblocker can help you get rid of the adverts. However, the site's performance may suffer as a result. So, if you don't want to deal with ads, you may want to pay for a subscription.

Everyone should access the content they want legally, regardless of where they are. Crackle can be unblocked with a premium virtual private network if you're outside the United States.

There is no need to join Crackle to create a watch list. Users of Roku, Firestick/FireTV, iOS, and Android devices can access this website. It can also be accessed via the internet.

**Features:**

* Website's inventory is often updated
* Crackle can be unblocked with a premium virtual private network

### 7.GoStream

![gostream-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gostream-poster.png)

GoStream, one of the best sites like FMovies, is the last entry on our list. As with the other sites described above, this one focuses on providing you with the most recent movies for free, with a preview and an IMDb rating for each one of them.

However, if you're looking for movies that were out in a certain year, your search may come up short. Streaming is as simple as clicking the "start" button when you see anything intriguing.

As a bonus, the videos load quickly and you don't need a username or password to begin watching. Only a few redirections are included in this site's advertising. Before you begin streaming, we suggest that you verify the quality of the movie, since some on the site are of low quality.

**Features:**

* One focuses on providing you with the most recent movies for free
* Videos load quickly and you don't need a username or password to begin watching

## Conclusions

There are no more Fmovie Alternatieves on our list. It's not simple to replace FMovies, but you won't miss it that much if you use the alternatives suggested. Be sure to forward this list along to your friends and family so they may take advantage of these top FMovie alternatives as well! Leave a comment with your top suggestion and we'll have a look.

Crackle has increased in popularity over the last several years and is a great alternative to FMovies for moviegoers. Sony owns the website, thus you have full access to Sony's whole library. In addition, the website's inventory is often updated, so you'll always find something fresh to watch.

Users may also search for such a film by genre, actor, and title on Crackle, making it easy to find what they're looking for quickly.

All users outside of the United States are restricted from using the platform since it is ad-supported and geo-blocked. A good adblocker can help you get rid of the adverts. However, the site's performance may suffer as a result. So, if you don't want to deal with ads, you may want to pay for a subscription.

Everyone should access the content they want legally, regardless of where they are. Crackle can be unblocked with a premium virtual private network if you're outside the United States.

There is no need to join Crackle to create a watch list. Users of Roku, Firestick/FireTV, iOS, and Android devices can access this website. It can also be accessed via the internet.

**Features:**

* Website's inventory is often updated
* Crackle can be unblocked with a premium virtual private network
