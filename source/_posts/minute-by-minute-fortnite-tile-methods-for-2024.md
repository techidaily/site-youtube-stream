To grow a Youtube channel, you need to focus on several different factors and elements. Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.

Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn't require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.

**Step 01:** To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.

**Step 02:** If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.

# Top 9 Free YouTube Logo Makers

Logos are a very important part of branding yourself, especially if you’re an online business or personality, and that's why we've made this list of YouTube logo makers. When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, we’ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.

1. [PIXLR EDITOR](#pixlr)
2. [GETPAINT](#getpaint)
3. [CANVA](#canva)
4. [DESIGNEVO](#designevo)
5. [LOGOMAKR](#logomakr)
6. [FOTOR](#fotor)
7. [SNAPPA](#snappa)
8. [LOGASTER](#logaster)
9. [COOLTEXT](#cooltext)

## 1\. [PIXLR EDITOR](https://pixlr.com/editor/)

PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If you’re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, you’re going to have to design it from scratch.

## 2\. [GETPAINT](https://www.getpaint.net/)

GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, you’re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.

## 3\. [CANVA](https://www.canva.com/)

Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.

## 4\. [DESIGNEVO](https://www.designevo.com/)

Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.

## 5\. [LOGOMAKR](https://logomakr.com/)

Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.

## 6\. [FOTOR](https://www.fotor.com/)

Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.

## 7\. [SNAPPA](https://snappa.com/)

Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.

## 8\. [LOGASTER](https://www.logaster.com/)

For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.

## 9\. [COOLTEXT](https://cooltext.com/)

Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.

If you want free templates that will work with a lot of these logo makers, check out our post on [YouTube Profile Picture Templates - Free Downloads!](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html)

Have you ever used a YouTube logo maker?

## 3\. [CANVA](https://www.canva.com/)

Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.

## 4\. [DESIGNEVO](https://www.designevo.com/)

Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.

## 5\. [LOGOMAKR](https://logomakr.com/)

Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.

## 6\. [FOTOR](https://www.fotor.com/)

Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.

## 7\. [SNAPPA](https://snappa.com/)

Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.

## 8\. [LOGASTER](https://www.logaster.com/)

For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.

## 9\. [COOLTEXT](https://cooltext.com/)

Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.
