Ever think about how to get a YouTube video trending? It can come down to picking a topic that's trending.

A trending topic is a subject which a lot of people are currently interested in. If you learn how to tap into what’s popular and cover it in creative and innovative ways then that will help your channel grow more quickly. You’ll get more views, more subscribers, and higher search rankings by following these simple tips.

1. **[Think of 'Trending' as Relevant](#relevant)**
2. **[Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche](#niche)**
3. **[Aim for Number 1](#aim)**
4. **[Success Doesn't Mean Making a Viral Video](#viral)**
5. **[The Subscriber Snowball Effect](#snowball)**

[![guide-to-grow-youtube-subscribers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide-to-grow-youtube-subscribers-download-btn.png)](https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers?utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fcampaign=get%5Fsubs%5Fevergreen&utm%5Fcontent=blog%202)

## **1\. Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant**

Instead of thinking of a trending video as a video that everyone is doing, think of it as a subject that is relevant to a lot of people. You want to cover topics that a lot of people care about.

A lot of YouTubers see huge channels have a lot of success posting videos that are very focused on the personal life of the creator (i.e. ‘I had the WORST day’) or which have very vague or sensational titles (i.e. ‘The horse knows what it did’) and decide that those are the kinds of videos they want to do too. However, the only reason large channels are able to be successful with these kinds of videos and titles is that they are already big. These creators have already grown themselves huge audiences of people who know and are interested in them personally.

As a smaller creator, you will not be successful if you only aim to do videos that are focused on you and your life. For example, if you have 100 subscribers and make a vlog about how your day went, then you have 100 people who may potentially find that interesting. The content might be good, but it won’t help you grow.

## **2\. Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche**

**![find your niche](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/niche-find-your-niche.jpg)**

Taking on trending topics shouldn’t mean taking on topics you aren’t actually interested in or don’t care about. Every genre on YouTube has its own trends, and you will often know about them just by virtue of watching other channels in your genre and talking to people who are interested in the same things as you. For example, if you’re a Gamer and your friends are also Gamers then you probably already know what Gamers are currently interested in.

If you do need help determining trends, here are 2 ways to do it:

1. Visit 3 of the most popular channels in your genre (i.e. gaming, beauty, or prank) and see if there’s any overlap in the themes of their most recent videos.
2. Go to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.ca/trends/) and look at the categories most relevant to your genre. [To learn how to use Google Trends](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## **3\. Aim for Number 1**

**![think-in-divergent-way](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-in-divergent-way.jpg)**

Being trendy doesn’t mean you can’t be original. If you know what’s popular in your genre then that will enable you to ask yourself ‘what’s on-trend, but not being covered yet?’.

For example, if you know that relationship videos – topics like ‘how do you know a guy likes you?’ – are doing well then you can think about what other aspects of dating people might be interested in that don’t have many videos on them yet. If you’re one of the first to tackle something that’s on-trend you have a much better chance of getting that number 1 search engine ranking, and higher ranked videos always get more views.

## **4\. Success Doesn't Mean Making a Viral Video**

**![viral-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viral-video.png)**

There’s a common misconception that in order to grow your channel you need to make your videos go viral. The truth is that having one or two viral videos probably won’t help you much. People don’t subscribe to one video, they subscribe for consistently good content.

It’s much better to have 10 videos on a popular topic that are doing alright than it is to have that one big viral hit. Those 10 videos will consistently bring in new viewers to your channel who are more likely to subscribe because they can see you have other content they’re interested in.

## **5\. The Subscriber Snowball Effect**

**![snowball-effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snowball-effect.jpg)**

When you make multiple videos around a trending topic, they’re more likely to come up as ‘related’ to each other than if you only cover the topic in one video. If someone enjoys one of your videos on that topic and can see there’s another right there in the related videos, there’s a good chance they’ll click on it.

This gets you more views on multiple videos, and more subscribers because it builds the expectation that you’re going to continue to keep covering relevant topics. Having viewers click from video to video on your channel also increases your watch time, which YouTube’s algorithm takes as a sign that they should rank your videos higher in search results (getting you even more views).

Do you have any of your own tips for how to get a YouTube video trending?

Finding the trend is integral for YouTube channel growth. A user-friendly video editing software will simplify the process of editing videos and saves your efforts. Get **Wondershare Filmora** by clicking the button below to make the coolest videos and see your viewers boom.

Who doesn’t love Gifs? They are one of the most entertaining means to communicate on the internet. But have you tried creating a GIF from YouTube videos? Generally, GIFs use humorous or relevant scenes from movies or shows to make them relatable to the situation. If you’re someone who wants to create GIFs from YouTube, this is for you.

The article below will show you how to create GIFs from YouTube videos on the desktop computers and mobile devices with some free online GIF makers and apps.

## Part 1: How to Create GIFs from a YouTube Video on the Computer?

### 1\.  FreeGifMAKER.me

FreeGifMaker is a simple online tool that allows the creation of animated Gifs free of cost. A minimum of two pictures has to be uploaded out of ten. It’s super easy and takes a couple of minutes to make a GIF from a YouTube video.

Find out how to create GIFs using FreeGifMaker.me using these steps.

1. Open the website on your desktop by typing <http://freegifmaker.me/youtube-to-gif/>
2. Go to YouTube and copy the URL of the video you want to make a GIF. Paste it on the above-mentioned website.
1. Click on “Load YouTube Video” below the URL space and wait for a few seconds while the tool checks the video source.
2. After the YouTube video is loaded, finally enter the gif duration, start time and click on the “Make a GIF button” and it will redirect you to the result page.

### 2\.  VEED.IO

 VEED is another easy way to make GIFs from YouTube videos. VEED allows you to copy a YouTube video link of your choice and paste it on VEED without any difficulty. VEED not only creates GIFs from YouTube videos but also gives few more facilities like trimming, adding text, cropping to the clip which helps in creating super-cool GIFs. VEED has both free and Pro versions and is a perfect browser software.

How to use VEED only in 3 steps, know about it below:

1. First, you need to copy the link to the YouTube video of your choice and paste it into VEED. From there the software will start importing the video into its project editor and you can start creating the GIF from there.
2. For the editing part, you need to trim the part of the video in which you want to make the GIF and crop the GIF. You can easily do that by choosing the canvas size menu available. After that, you can add text, font style, color, and size to your GIF.
3. In the last step, you just have to download the GIF which you have made in VEED.

### 3\.  Kapwing

Kapwing is a great stage for creating GIFs as well as videos and images. Kapwing is one of the most used and liked online video editors available. It provides one single step for all the things to do while creating a GIF – upload, editing, and sharing the file.

To create unique GIFs with Kapwing, follow these easy steps.

1. First, you need to open Kapwing video editor and copy the URL of the YouTube video of your choice and paste it on Kapwing to create your GIF from the video. Any video which is shorter than 30 minutes and less than 500 MB is supported by Kapwing.
2. Once you have uploaded the video, you will find the video appearing in the timeline. The section of the video that you want to make the GIF of needs to be cut with the sliders which are available at the end. A GIF can be usually of any length but to maintain good resolution, it is always advised to not make the segment more than 10 seconds.
3. You can preview the GIF you created after trimming the video which will allow you to see how the final output would be like. Other edits such as cropping, adding text, and experimenting with the speed can be done on Kapwing as well.
