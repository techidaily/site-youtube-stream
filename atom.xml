Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5.

The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice.

Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience-1"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic-3"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story-3"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting-3"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot-3"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5. Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Prepared-3"><a href="#6-Be-Prepared-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Prepared"></a><strong>6. Be Prepared</strong></h2><p>While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.</p><p>Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…</p><p>Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.</p><p>Take a look at <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w" >Ashley Nichole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.</p><h2 id="7-Be-Expressive-3"><a href="#7-Be-Expressive-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Expressive"></a><strong>7. Be Expressive</strong></h2><p>Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.</p><p>If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.</p><p>Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.</p><p>Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera? Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg" >Emma Chamberlain <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, if you haven’t already. Every word she says in her video is layered with emotion. We know exactly how she feels.</p><h2 id="8-Stay-Organized-3"><a href="#8-Stay-Organized-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

Can I entice you with a free YouTube movie?</p><p>To watch full-length movies for free, you don’t need to rent a movie or sign up for a YouTube Premium subscription. Hundreds of movies are accessible for free on YouTube if you don’t mind having your movie-watching pleasure interrupted by the occasional ad.</p><p>If you’re willing to pay to stream, YouTube boasts as large a collection of new movies as anyone.

As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.</p><p>The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg"                      alt="giant techs behind av1"                ></p><p>Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a “standard” 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now. These are some more reasons why you should choose AV1.</p><h3 id="1-Royalty-free"><a href="#1-Royalty-free" class="headerlink" title="1. Royalty-free"></a>1. Royalty-free</h3><p>As mentioned before, AV1 is royalty-free. AV1 is such a next-generation of royalty video codec. It means that it is not just free to use, but also free of charge, obligations, or even liability. It is an open and royalty-free video codec that the video platform will not charge to pay royalties to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the developer of video codecs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-5.jpg"                      alt="av1 is royalty-free"                ></p><p>When it comes to the group that will ask for the royalty, MPEG is not the only one. There are also other patent groups and companies that can ask for it. Aomedia integrated Google, Mozilla, and Cisco, while they were busy creating their new video codec. However, the three companies joined together to create one codec to beat them all.</p><h3 id="2-Better-performance"><a href="#2-Better-performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Better performance"></a>2. Better performance</h3><p>It is said that the AV1 codec is 30% more efficient. According to the tests conducted by Moscow State University, AV1 can outperform AV1 by about 28% in the efficiency of encoding and decoding. As per the performance graph from the Graphics &amp; Media Lab Video Group, MSU below, AV1 can offer the exactly same quality as X264 at 55% of the average bitrate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-6.jpg"                      alt="av1 benefit"                ></p><p>AV1 is designed so exclusively to function better than all the other codecs in the market. It is an open-sourced codec with simple patent licensing, and the integration manages to save, as mentioned, up to 30% of the bandwidth for the exactly same image quality. In other words, with AV1, distributors can send streams much faster and cheaper and we can enjoy higher definitions in the same bandwidth.</p><h3 id="3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future"><a href="#3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="3. AV2 to come in the future"></a>3. AV2 to come in the future</h3><p>AV1 is undoubtedly superior if we compare it to other available video codecs and the exploration of the codec technology AV2 has already begun. This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row&#x2F;column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.</p><p>There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC&#x2F;H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original. We haven’t known yet when AV2 will be done completely though, maybe there still be some more essential improvements.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?"></a>Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube, it feels incomplete if we don’t talk about the video editor.

How you set up your talking-head shot depends on many factors, including how much space you have, what kind of look you’re going for, and how many people you want to fit in one frame. Here are four ways to set up your talking-head shots for YouTube.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table of Contents <a href="#Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up">1.

It is welcomed to share on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/talking-heads-youtube-video-shots-set-up.jpg"                      alt="Setting up Talking Heads Video Shots for YouTube"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Your-Talking-Head-Shots-for-YouTube-4-Ways"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Your-Talking-Head-Shots-for-YouTube-4-Ways" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Your Talking-Head Shots for YouTube [4 Ways]"></a>How to Set Up Your Talking-Head Shots for YouTube [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="1-Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#1-Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background. At the 1:30 mark of this trailer video, you can briefly see how the Masterclass camera crew set up their shot.</p><h3 id="3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up"></a>3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If your talking-head shot has got to include two people, you can use a similar set-up as the medium vlog set-up detailed above.</p><p>If you look back at the 39-second mark of deadmau5’s Masterclass trailer, you can see that there’s a lot of space to the left and right of deadmau5. Now imagine the same shot but with two people.</p><p>With two people, though, you’ll want to set up your mic slightly differently. Rather than using a directional shotgun mic with a narrow area of sensitivity, you’ll want to use a directional mic with a wider area of sensitivity.</p><h3 id="4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up"></a>4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you want to read over a script but still make it appear like you’re looking straight into the camera, you’ll need to use a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll need all the same equipment as the medium vlog set-up, but you’ll additionally need a teleprompter placed in front of your camera equipped with a long telephoto lens.</p><p>You will have to sit much further back away from your camera for two main reasons. Firstly, you want to be able to fit yourself in your much more zoomed-in camera frame (effect of the long telephoto lens). Secondly, you want to be far enough that the camera cannot detect your eyes reading from left to right. You’ll want to be around six meters away from a 17” teleprompter monitor or around four meters away from a 10” teleprompter monitor.</p><p>In the above video, Jared Polin uses a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>In the video, he says there’s about 8 feet (2.4 meters) between himself and his lens.

Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

If you are interested in installing fonts in Filmora, watch this video to learn how.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you generate thumbnails for your YouTube videos, it would be wise to ensure you make them full-sized. The ideal dimension for a YouTube thumbnail should be 1280*720. Since most of your viewers use their mobile phones to watch YouTube videos, it would help to ensure the thumbnail looks the same on your laptop and your mobile device.</p><p>A hazy or pixelated thumbnail could discourage the viewer from clicking on your video. We hope you have found a font you like and will incorporate it into your next YouTube video.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/from-ordinary-to-extraordinary-your-path-to-awesome-unboxings-for-2024/"><u>From Ordinary to Extraordinary  Your Path to Awesome Unboxings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-turning-hobby-into-habit-making-money-with-vlogs/"><u>In 2024, Turning Hobby Into Habit  Making Money with Vlogs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/mastering-youtubes-feature-switch-between-commenting-states-for-2024/"><u>Mastering YouTube's Feature  Switch Between Commenting States for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-idea-to-impact-top-8-online-courses-for-new-creators/"><u>In 2024, From Idea to Impact  Top 8 Online Courses for New Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-royalty-free-sounds-for-youtube-clips/"><u>In 2024, Navigating Royalty-Free Sounds for YouTube Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/mastering-youtube-shorts-for-profit-essential-requirements-and-potential-earnings-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Youtube Shorts for Profit  Essential Requirements and Potential Earnings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-inside-the-earnings-loop-how-you-benefit-from-your-channel/"><u>2024 Approved  Inside the Earnings Loop  How You Benefit From Your Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-apple-iphone-se-passcode-without-a-computer-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Apple iPhone SE Passcode without a Computer | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/the-easiest-methods-to-hard-reset-vivo-v29e-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>The Easiest Methods to Hard Reset Vivo V29e | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-capture-and-share-your-mac-life-free-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capture & Share Your Mac Life, FREE for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/gone-sticker-refining-vids-for-a-slick-tiktok-presence/"><u>Gone Sticker  Refining Vids for a Slick TikTok Presence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/directory-for-acquiring-cat-sound-effects-in-audio-format/"><u>Directory for Acquiring Cat Sound Effects in Audio Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-oppo-f25-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Oppo F25 Pro 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/are-you-tired-of-spending-too-much-time-on-video-editing-learn-the-most-effective-ways-to-manage-your-timeline-and-streamline-your-video-editing-process-for/"><u>Are You Tired of Spending Too Much Time on Video Editing?

It is evident that a video must have a perfect soundtrack for video masterpieces, but ensuring it is copyright free music is a must.</p><p>It is because you would never want YouTube to remove your video due to copyright violation after working so hard on it. Fortunately, there are a few trusted resources that offer perfect royalty free music for youtube videos.</p><p>Here is a list of 10 best royalty free music for videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-‘Royalty-Free’-Mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-‘Royalty-Free’-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean?"></a>Part 1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean?</h2><p>‘Royalty free’ does not mean that the artist has given up ownership of their music, just that they have licensed it for others to use. Licenses have conditions, but they should not affect your ability to use royalty free music in your vlog. The most common condition for using royalty free music is that you need to credit the artist, which can be as simple as including a ‘music by’ note in your video’s description.</p><p>Because royalty free music still has a copyright claim on it YouTube may occasionally flag your video even though you are only using music you are allowed to use. YouTube’s flagging system is automated and prone to error. If your video is incorrectly flagged you can dispute it with YouTube and get your video cleared again.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</h2><h3 id="1-YouTube-Audio-Library"><a href="#1-YouTube-Audio-Library" class="headerlink" title="1.

A typical CTA (‘call to action’) goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Thanks for watching. If you liked this video, make sure to subscribe for more!”</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s great. At the end of a video is a good place to ask people to subscribe, but is it the best and only place you should be reminding them? If you take a peek at your analytics and you might find that most of your viewers aren’t watching to the ends of your videos (people have short attention spans).</p><h2 id="A-More-Effective-Way-of-Asking-For-Subscribers"><a href="#A-More-Effective-Way-of-Asking-For-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers"></a>A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers</h2><p>Collins Key is one YouTuber who has mastered asking for subscribers early on, and given that he has over 7 million subscribers himself I’d say it’s working out.

This is one way in which the viewer is immediately hooked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-by-hook.jpg"                      alt="how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly"><a href="#Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly"></a>Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly</h4><p>Shortly after, while still in the first 30 seconds of the video, Collins gets right to the point and introduces the Twin Telepathy Challenge promised in the title of the video. The hook with the heater catching fire is effective, but it’s not essential. It happens to suit Collins’ style, and it happens to have happened. Getting to the main point of the video quickly – usually in the first 15 seconds, not the first 30 (it’s in the first 15 seconds that most viewers click away) – is vital. People click on videos for a reason, and if they don’t see a sign of that payoff quickly they’ll leave.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience"><a href="#Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience"></a>Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience</h4><p>It’s only after hooking the viewer in and reiterating the promise of the title that Collins asks viewers to subscribe. The really clever thing about how he asks is that he carves out time in the video for the viewer to comply with his request. He gives 5 seconds and does a countdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-in-perfect-moment.jpg"                      alt="how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><p>Collins Key has been one of the fastest-growing channels on YouTube. He does not implement this strategy in every video, but it’s not a stretch to think it’s had something to do with his success. Instead of simply asking you to subscribe at the end of the video, he creates a part of the video early on – before people who don’t watch until the end will have clicked away – where you feel as if you’re ‘supposed to’ subscribe.</p><h3 id="Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p>Even with the above tricks, you may not get the subscribers as you wish unless you can make sure your videos and contents are of high quality.

Getting people to watch them is the next and a much bigger obstacle in your path. Just as a blogger must work hard to get people to read their blog, so a YouTuber needs to find ways to get more views on their videos.</p><p>For any piece of content on the internet, discoverability is key to exposure. After all, nobody will watch your video or read your blog if they can’t find it, right? A blogger would do this by lacing their content with SEO - search engine optimization. But how can a YouTuber do the same? The answer lies in something known as YouTube tags optimization. In this article, we will let you know how to <strong>add, edit and optimize YouTube tags</strong> easily for more views, and some tips on <strong>YouTube title and description</strong>.</p><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">What are YouTube tags and why they are so important</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to come up with YouTube tags and optimize them</a></li><li><a href="#part3">How to Tag YouTube and Add Title, Description</a></li><li><a href="#part4">How to Improve YouTube video Metadata: Tags, Title, Description</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description</a></li></ul><hr><p>Before we get started, I want to recommend the best video editing software for YouTubers - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an easy to use while powerful video editor that allows you not only to cut, split, crop, resize, reverse your videos, but also offers you multiple video effects specially designed for Fashion, Beauty, Gaming, Travel, Education, etc. Check the video to know more fantastic features:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-YouTube-tags-and-why-they-are-so-important"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-YouTube-tags-and-why-they-are-so-important" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are YouTube tags and why they are so important"></a>Part 1: What are YouTube tags and why they are so important</h2><p>YouTube tags are used when you upload a video on YouTube. You need to specify the type of video. In other words, you need to describe your video with keywords. But you might think about why you need to add these words. YouTube can’t figure out what my videos are about? Unfortunately, YouTube can’t though its algorithm is much more advanced than before.</p><p>You must know the competition between videos is furious since <a class="link"   href="https://tubularinsights.com/hours-minute-uploaded-youtube/" >500 hours of video per minute are uploaded on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this case, it is important to let the YouTube algorithm know your video by adding related tags to have a higher ranking. So the better tags we choose, the higher chance to rank in the top 1, which means you will get more views!</p><p>Using YouTube meta tags wisely can broaden your reach and help new people discover your content. However, don’t be tempted to insert irrelevant tags just because you know they are high traffic. You will be found out and penalized as a result. Just as you did with your description, research your keywords, place the most important ones first and use as many as you can.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types"><a href="#What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types" class="headerlink" title="What are the three YouTube tag types?"></a>What are the three YouTube tag types?</h3><p>YouTube has three different types of tags and each of them has a specific purpose. The tags are-</p><p><strong>Specific</strong> – The specific tag types are keywords-oriented. These keywords specifically pertain to the content of your video. In this tag type, the particular video is highlighted with the keyword tags. Often while typing the keywords in your mind, YouTube suggests phrases and keywords according to the content of your video. You may apply the suggestions and also add more general or common versions of the same keywords.</p><p><strong>Compound</strong> – The compound tags are usually using more than two words. Many a time it is seen that users prefer tagging the complete title of the video. If you are using your video title as the compound tag, ensure that you do not include the prepositions like or, as, and, etc. This is because YouTube allows just 500 characters in the title and ignore the prepositions. It is always advised to use all the 500 characters YouTube has allowed without wasting the characters on prepositions as it will automatically be ignored.</p><p><strong>Generic</strong> – The generic tags are the ones that describe the entire video in one or two words. These tags are used in all the videos of yours. These tags are used across your channel for all the videos you post. It is important to have such general constant tags.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them"></a>Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them</h2><p>The more relevant tags you add, the better it is. The best part is YouTube doesn’t restrict the number of tags but adding all is not possible and adding something irrelevant doesn’t make sense. So, your YouTube video tags must be the smart ones for more views. Educated tagging is what is required.</p><p>1. <strong>Brand-Specific Tags Addition</strong> - Every business wants their brand name to show up in the search results on YouTube and Google. Self-referencing your video or tagging your brand name in a number of variations is a smart way of letting others know your brand.</p><p>2. <strong>Using YouTube Auto Suggest</strong> – Play with the search option on YouTube and check out the YouTube suggestions when you search. Try to recognize the common videos that pop up while searching for something important and relevant to yours. Try searching for random keywords according to your YouTube search experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-suggest.jpg"                      alt="youtube auto suggest"                ></p><p>3. <strong>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/" >YouTube Keyword Search Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – Lastly, you may use the YouTube keyword suggestion tool. It helps you to extract the relevant keywords from the videos of your competitors and create suggestions according to the basic term provided by you.</p><p>4. <strong>Use Specific Tags</strong> - After using tools, you need to narrow down your tags specifically, like tags “learn 3D paper cutting”. The search volume may not be huge, but these kinds of tags can let YouTube know your video very well. Give it a try!</p><p>5. <strong>Check competitor’s Tags</strong> - When you check tags from other brands, it is not suggested to copy them all. What you need to do is find what you are missing and try to cover that area. However, only third-party tools can help you do that. In the market, <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is highly used. It has a free version.

You can use singular and plural tags. Sometimes remember to add some misspelling tags because users tend to mistype some words, so it’s better to cover this kind of tag.

It helps people search for your video, helps YouTube to categorize it correctly and, when done well, can broaden the reach of your content. YouTube meta consists of three main parts: tags, title and description. Here’s how you can use each of these three elements to create powerful metadata for your video:</p><h3 id="1-Title"><a href="#1-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Title"></a>1. Title</h3><p>YouTube titles play a big part in the ranking factors for search. That means you’ve got to think about what the people most likely to want to see your video will type into the search bar, as well as the words that accurately describe your video.</p><p>For example, if you have a clip of your cat Fluffy climbing a tree, calling your video ‘Fluffy climbs a tree’ is not the best idea. Nobody knows who Fluffy is; it could be your rabbit, dog, daughter or feather duster for all the YouTube community knows, and nobody is going to be searching for it.</p><p>A better title would be ‘cat climbs a tree, but you could even improve on that. How about ‘funny cat climbs a tree’, which would capture all those people looking for funny cat videos. Or, even better, ‘funny Persian cat climbs a tree’, also capturing those people who adore Persian cats.</p><p>You can see how building awesome YouTube titles can happen organically like this, but it’s also worth doing your homework too. We have collected a handful of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to improve your YouTube meta, so check out the suggestions and work forwards from there.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Research your keywords and include high traffic keywords at the start of the title</li><li>Keep titles under 70 characters</li><li>Branding, episode number, and other non-essential info should be at the end of the title</li><li>Review your YouTube titles from time to time and update with new keywords as search trends change</li><li>Avoid clickbait titles or misleading titles as this will affect your view time and subsequently your ranking in search</li></ul><h3 id="2-Description"><a href="#2-Description" class="headerlink" title="2. Description"></a>2. Description</h3><p>Your description is a much longer piece of YouTube meta, so you can really go to town with your YouTube keywords here. You’ve got up to 5,000 characters to fill in, and we strongly advise that you aim to use every single one. This really is a golden opportunity, not only to get people motivated to watch all of your video, but also to be indexed correctly through well researched YouTube keywords.</p><p>You may have noticed that, on the search page itself, only a small part of the description actually shows up; 120 characters of it to be precise. This doesn’t affect indexing, but it does mean you have to plan your YouTube description carefully to really hook people into clicking through from just the first sentence or two.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Make the first sentence or two compelling and captivating to get people to click</li><li>Research the best YouTube keywords to use to ensure your video is correctly indexed</li><li>At the end of your YouTube description, include a call to action to direct viewers on what to do next (subscribe, click through to the website, look at a product, watch more videos, etc.)</li><li>If your video is long, consider placing time codes in your description to help users jump to their areas of interest</li><li>Add links to products showcased, your social channels, or website as you wish</li><li>Don’t forget to credit any music you’ve used here</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description"></a>Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description</h2><p>So, now we’ve got the basics down, let’s move on to some top tips for getting your metadata just right:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Do not spam</strong></li></ul><p>Irrelevant keywords will not do you any favors in the long run. Using a popular search term such as ‘funny cat’ when actually it’s a video of you unboxing your product will simply irritate your viewers. You’ll get more views, but for shorter durations, and that will hurt not only your ranking but also your reputation. The people you want to draw in with your YouTube meta should be those who are genuinely interested in your videos, as these are the people who will share, comment and interact with you.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Don’t put tags in the description</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube has given you a place to put your tags, and that’s not in the description area of your meta. Placing tags in the description area is known as tag stuffing and can lead to videos being removed or penalized.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Update regularly</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube meta is not a static thing. Trends change, search statistics fluctuate, and the needs of your viewers alter as time goes on. For this reason, you should look to update your meta from time to time, at least once every six months or so. Re-research your keywords and optimize for today’s trending search terms.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube SEO Complete Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Take some time to perfect your meta on YouTube and see how many more views it helps you get.
