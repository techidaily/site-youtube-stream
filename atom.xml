Other file formats like 3GPP and MPEG-PS generally have resolutions too small for high-resolution tablets or desktop devices.</p><p>If your phone or video editing software does not output MP4 videos, consider getting video editing software or a conversion program that can (like Filmora Video Editor).</p><p>Filmora is an easy-to-use video editing program that can export to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, F4V, MKV, TS, 3GP, MPEG-2, WEBM, GIF, and MP3. You can convert a video to an MP4 simply by importing it into Filmora, dragging it into the timeline, and exporting it in the MP4 format.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best Upload Settings for YouTube"></a>The Best Upload Settings for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The best video code:</strong></p><p><strong>The best video format:</strong> MP4</p><p>Audio should be produced using the LC format and stereo 5.1 or standard stereo. You can upload separate MP3 audio format files for voiceovers if you need to.</p><p>The aspect ratio for a video should be 16:9 so that it won’t have black bars on the side when uploaded to YouTube. YouTube has also made it possible for 9:16 (portrait) style videos to be viewed without black bars, full screen, using their iOS app.</p><p>You should export in at least 30 frames per second. Many creators push that to 60 frames per second, which is better for most types of videos (although it may not make a noticeable difference for others).</p><p>The maximum size for quick upload and load time on YouTube is generally under 2gb. Luckily MP4 offers a great degree of compression without sacrificing too much image quality.</p><p>If you scale down the file size of the video by reducing the resolution or choosing a format with more compression, that can cause you to lose quality. If you need a smaller file, it’s always better to scale down the length of a video rather than continually compress the file or lose frames from the video.</p><p>Although a 2 GB file of a very long will easily upload to YouTube, it will probably be very low quality.</p><p> Do you agree that MP4 is the best video format for YouTube, or do you use something else?</p><h2 id="Create-Stunning-Videos-with-a-High-Quality-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Create-Stunning-Videos-with-a-High-Quality-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Create Stunning Videos with a High-Quality Video Editor"></a>Create Stunning Videos with a High-Quality Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-gradient-goes-night-premieres-trick/"><u>[Updated] Gradient Goes Night Premiere's Trick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/1722998066707-anthem-game-fix-how-to-stop-that-persistent-loading-screen/"><u>Anthem Game Fix: How to Stop That Persistent Loading Screen!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/decoding-popular-online-platforms-the-power-of-facebook-twitter-instagram-and-youtube-in-digital-conversations/"><u>Decoding Popular Online Platforms: The Power of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & Youtube in Digital Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-a-lava-yuva-3-phone-that-is-locked-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Reset a Lava Yuva 3 Phone That Is Locked | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-ispoofer-on-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use iSpoofer on Oppo A18?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-Through-Non-Displaying-Thumbnails-on-Your-Shorts"><a href="#Navigating-Through-Non-Displaying-Thumbnails-on-Your-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Navigating Through Non-Displaying Thumbnails on Your Shorts"></a>Navigating Through Non-Displaying Thumbnails on Your Shorts</h2><p>Video thumbnails are important since they encourage people to click and watch the video. But what if your set <strong>YouTube Shorts thumbnail is not showing</strong>? YouTube will use a random part of the video as the thumbnail. It may be an unflattering or uninteresting shot. Then, your Shorts video is doomed.</p><p>That said, it is a problem you want to solve. Here are 7 FAQs about YouTube Shorts thumbnails. They may help you with fixing this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif"                      alt="youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><h2 id="Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.</p><p>Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the “Plus” icon at the bottom center &gt; “Create Short.” Upload, edit, and post your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-1.jpg"                      alt="creating shorts on youtube app"                ></p><ul><li>Get to your desktop computer or laptop. Open your channel’s YouTube Studio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-2.JPG"                      alt="opening youtube studio on computer"                ></p><ul><li>On the left navigation menu, click “Content.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-3.JPG"                      alt="content section on youtube studio"                ></p><ul><li>Click the “pencil” icon next to the Shorts you just uploaded. This video should be at the top of the list.</li><li>Navigate to the Thumbnail section. Click “Create Thumbnail.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-5.JPG"                      alt="changing shorts thumbnail on youtube studio"                ></p><h2 id="Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing"><a href="#Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing" class="headerlink" title="Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?"></a>Q3. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fix-youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.JPG"                      alt="fix youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, there is no reliable fix to this problem yet. YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.</p><p>Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.</p><h2 id="Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful and easy-to-use video editor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-filmora.JPG"                      alt="filmora mobile feature showcase"                ></p><p>The best thing is that you don’t need to transfer the video from your phone to your computer and back.

And Filmora gives you access to all of that.

Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP. They made it easier for Shorts content creators to get into the program.</p><h2 id="Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal"><a href="#Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal" class="headerlink" title="Q7.

The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change.

Viewers find poor lighting distracting and it’s hard for them to see how great your content is if they are busy thinking about why your video is so dark. By creating a great lighting set up you can ensure that the people watching your videos are only thinking about how much they’re enjoying them.</p><p>Going outside and using natural light is the cheapest way to get a lot of light for your videos. If your vlog is not suited to the great outdoors then you need to get more strategic. You can turn on all the lights in your living room and still end up with a dark, grainy, video.</p><h2 id="Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting"><a href="#Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting"></a>Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt=" Lighting for YouTube Video"                ></p><p>The most common technique of lighting a scene is called <strong>three-point lighting</strong>. It involves three different sources of light in the shot and is used by portrait photographers, which is also a great method for lighting your vlog.</p><p>The brightest source of light is also known as the <strong>key light</strong> which need to be high quality. A window will work, but if you do not have access to one where you are filming then consider an LED panel light or a softbox light like the ones used in portrait photography.</p><p>This first light will create a dramatic shadow across half of your face. You want to reduce this shadow, but not get rid of it completely.</p><p>Rather than setting up another light source on the opposite side of the camera, put up a reflector to bounce some light back onto your face. This reflector is called your <strong>‘Fill Light’</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fill light</strong> is less bright than the primary source of light and it is placed on the side opposite to the key light. Its purpose is to reduce shadows produced by the key light and the reflector will need to be mounted on a stand.</p><p>The final step to creating three point lighting is to set up another light behind you. This is your ‘Backlight’, and it will help you stand out from your background. <strong>Backlight or Hair light</strong> is always placed behind and above the subject to create separation between the subject in the shot and the background. This basic lighting technique can be applied in almost every scene you shoot, which is why it is important to keep an open mind and to continue experimenting with possible light setups.</p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging"><a href="#Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!

These tips will help you make the first steps on that journey.</p><h4 id="1-Focus-Your-Key-Light"><a href="#1-Focus-Your-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="1.  Focus Your Key Light"></a>1.  Focus Your Key Light</h4><p>Try to focus your Key Light so that it lights only you and not your background. Do this by mounting anything that can cast a shadow onto your Key Light to control the area where the light hits. If you are using a window for your Key Light then you can use a curtain. If you use a softbox light then your light will already be somewhat focused.</p><h4 id="2-Use-Natural-Lighting"><a href="#2-Use-Natural-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Natural Lighting"></a>2. Use Natural Lighting</h4><p>The light provided by the Sun is still the best light source, you can have in your video. The trouble is that natural light changes quickly, which makes it highly unpredictable. The best way to deal with this challenge is to come prepared to the set and to get the shot you want as quickly as you can.</p><h4 id="3-Try-DIY-Lightning"><a href="#3-Try-DIY-Lightning" class="headerlink" title="3.  Try DIY Lightning"></a>3.  Try DIY Lightning</h4><p>Literally, anything from candles to LED light bulbs can serve as a source of light in a shot. You just need to pay attention to the light temperature, because warmer light sources may highlight reds and yellows that can make your footage look less realistic.</p><h4 id="4-Use-Lightning-Kits"><a href="#4-Use-Lightning-Kits" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Lightning Kits"></a>4. Use Lightning Kits</h4><p>This is by far the best option if you want to be in complete control of the light on your set. You can adjust the intensity of the lights, use filters, diffusers and all sorts of other accessories to create the light that flatters the subjects of your videos. The only downside is that you’ll have to spend a considerable amount of money if you want to have a professional lighting kit.</p><h4 id="5-Set-up-reflectors"><a href="#5-Set-up-reflectors" class="headerlink" title="5.  Set up reflectors"></a>5.  Set up reflectors</h4><p>Sets of reflectors are often under $50, so they are fairly affordable. However, some vloggers choose to forgo purchasing reflectors and make their own out of tinfoil.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-tips01.JPG"                      alt="lighting tips"                ></p><p>If your strong main light is too hard on your eyes then you can use a translucent ‘reflector’ to soften it. Set your translucent reflector, or other screen, up in front of your main light to diffuse it.</p><p>If you are hosting a <strong>beauty vlog</strong> then you might consider a slightly different set up. Instead of having your main light off to one side set it up directly in front of you so your entire face is lit evenly. It is still a good idea to use fill lights in this set up to give you some dimension, and a backlight is even more essential for helping you stand out from the background. The even light hitting your face will also make you look flat if you do not use a backlight.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-tips02.JPG"                      alt="lighting tips"                ></p><p>If you are using all of the lighting options available to you and your video still looks too dark then you can try brightening it by <strong>opening up the aperture of your camera</strong> lens&#x2F;setting a lower f-stop. Letting more light into your camera can help your footage look brighter, although you also run the risk of making things look overexposed&#x2F; washed out if you are not careful.</p><p>If you are stuck shooting in <strong>low light conditions</strong> it is best to use a lens with a wider aperture&#x2F;lower f-stop. This will make the best of the light you do have.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137201/26400" target="_top" id="2137201">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137201" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137201/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>One of the best things you can do for your video quality is to ensure you have great lighting.

It involves three different sources of light in the shot and is used by portrait photographers, which is also a great method for lighting your vlog.</p><p>The brightest source of light is also known as the <strong>key light</strong> which need to be high quality. A window will work, but if you do not have access to one where you are filming then consider an LED panel light or a softbox light like the ones used in portrait photography.</p><p>This first light will create a dramatic shadow across half of your face. You want to reduce this shadow, but not get rid of it completely.</p><p>Rather than setting up another light source on the opposite side of the camera, put up a reflector to bounce some light back onto your face. This reflector is called your <strong>‘Fill Light’</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fill light</strong> is less bright than the primary source of light and it is placed on the side opposite to the key light. Its purpose is to reduce shadows produced by the key light and the reflector will need to be mounted on a stand.</p><p>The final step to creating three point lighting is to set up another light behind you. This is your ‘Backlight’, and it will help you stand out from your background. <strong>Backlight or Hair light</strong> is always placed behind and above the subject to create separation between the subject in the shot and the background. This basic lighting technique can be applied in almost every scene you shoot, which is why it is important to keep an open mind and to continue experimenting with possible light setups.</p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging-2"><a href="#Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging-2" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!

Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075483/7443" target="_top" id="2075483">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075483" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075483/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

For instance, a Fullscreen partnership agreement requires you to share a percentage of your revenue in exchange for access to Fullscreen’s partnership perks. These perks include customized thumbnails as well as channel banners.</p><h3 id="How-to-Get-a-Fullscreen-Partnership-3"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-Fullscreen-Partnership-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a Fullscreen Partnership"></a>How to Get a Fullscreen Partnership</h3><p>Now that we’ve covered what the partnership actually is, let’s go ahead and take a look at how to actually become a Fullscreen partner. There are a few things that you should take into account before deciding to go down this road. There are regulations that your account needs to abide by. Let’s take a look:</p><ol><li>Your account cannot have any copyright strikes and must be in good standing.</li><li>Your channel needs to be at least 30 days old.</li><li>You must have at least 1,000 subscribers.</li><li>You need to have received at least 100 views per day for the last 30 days.</li></ol><p>If you meet these requirements, and Fullscreen sounds like a good fit for you, go ahead and <a class="link"   href="http://fullscreenmedia.co/apply/" >apply for partnership <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The first thing that you need to do is go to the Fullscreen website and find the Channels page. Scroll to the lowest point and request more information. Click the button to trigger the appearance of a form and write a message to Fullscreen. Once you’ve sent your message, Fullscreen is going to take between 1 and 7 days to respond. If accepted, you will have to sign a contract and provide screenshots that confirm that your account is in good standing on the YouTube.</p><h3 id="How-Fullscreen-Pays-You-3"><a href="#How-Fullscreen-Pays-You-3" class="headerlink" title="How Fullscreen Pays You"></a>How Fullscreen Pays You</h3><p>You’ve entered into a partnership agreement – now you need to start getting paid. The process is simple.</p><p>Fullscreen will pay you through PayPal. They will calculate how much you’ve earned, and you will get that amount transferred to your account. Make sure to check the amount that you’ve earned from the dashboard of Fullscreen itself.</p><p>Becoming a Fullscreen partner might be a good idea for your channel if the perks appeal to you. However, think about your own skills and whether you are confident in your ability to keep on growing your channel yourself. Fullscreen provides you with a wide range of comprehensive marketing tools, but a lot of video creators are able to master YouTube marketing using the tools YouTube already provides. Before you agree to split profits with an MCN (in addition to the portion already claimed by YouTube), make sure you are really going to be earning more profits than you could alone.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-Create-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Create-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip-Create Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip-Create Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> serves as an inevitable video editing software for video lovers.

And as you probably know, it can be tough to work fast and get good results when your hardware or laptop isn’t strong enough to power your software properly and allow you to work at the pace you want.</p><p>The best laptops for video editing in 2018 have three things in common. First, they have top-of-the-line display technology for color accuracy, color depth, and clarity. Next, they have discrete (dedicated) Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) with accompanying RAM to enable them to handle video processing fast without compromising other system functions. And finally, they have Intel core i7 CPU processors and Solid-State Drives (SSD) for faster overall performance.</p><h2 id="THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018"><a href="#THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018" class="headerlink" title="THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018"></a>THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018</h2><p>The top 3 laptops below are quite impressive. They have the right mix of power and function that video editing requires.</p><ol><li><a href="#macbook">MacBook Pro With Touch Bar</a></li><li><a href="#dell">Dell XPS 15</a></li><li><a href="#microsoft">Microsoft Surface Book 2</a></li></ol><h3 id="1-MACBOOK-PRO-WITH-TOUCH-BAR"><a href="#1-MACBOOK-PRO-WITH-TOUCH-BAR" class="headerlink" title="1.MACBOOK PRO WITH TOUCH BAR"></a>1.MACBOOK PRO WITH TOUCH BAR</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-pro-touch-bar.jpg"                      alt="Macbook pro touch bar"                ></p><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $1500 - $1800</p><p><strong>SYSTEM SPECS:</strong></p><p>CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor</p><p>GRAPHICS: Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB memory – 560 with 4GB memory</p><p>RAM: 16GB</p><p>SCREEN: 15.4” Retina Display</p><p>RES: 2880 x 1800px</p><p>STORAGE: 128 – 256GB SSD</p><p><strong>PROS</strong></p><ol><li>OLED Touch Bar</li><li>Thunderbolt 3 ports</li><li>Large Trackpad</li></ol><p> <strong>CONS:</strong></p><ol><li>No other input ports available besides Thunderbolt 3</li><li>Expensive</li></ol><p> The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the best video editing laptop produced by Apple. It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.</p><p>Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.</p><h3 id="2-DELL-XPS-15"><a href="#2-DELL-XPS-15" class="headerlink" title="2.

It’s considered the closest competitor to the MacBook Pro reviewed above. In fact, many would argue that it tops the MacBook Pro when it comes to speed, color accuracy, and color depth. Its 15.6” screen has very thin bezels for minimal distraction and immersive work experience. At 4K resolution and displaying a wide range of the sRGB gamut, video editing with the Dell XPS 15 promises to be both smooth and enjoyable.</p><p>The Dell XPS 15 is certainly more affordable, while still delivering excellent graphics performance. It features an Intel i7 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics processor. This makes it remarkably fast for video editing, as well as energy-efficient. People who work with different input devices will also like that this laptop has legacy adapters (USB, HDMI, ethernet) alongside a USB type C port.</p><p>The biggest downside to the Dell XPS 15 laptop is its oddly positioned webcam. It feels awkward and can be an inconvenience to use since you’ll have to adjust your position significantly while making video calls or recording for your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2"><a href="#3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

At a resolution of 3240 x 2160px, its screen is nearly 4k and can handle Full HD and HD footage with ease. Add to this its capacity to show a considerable portion of the sRGB gamut and its easy-to-use stylus and you can see why this 2-in-1 combo from Microsoft is one of the top 3 laptops for video editing in 2018.</p><p>Surface Book 2 also has the right combination of power and storage capacity that video editing requires. It boasts a state-of-the-art NVIDIA graphics processor and an Intel i7 processor for a smooth workflow no matter the size or level of detail involved in your video editing project.</p><p>On the downside, this laptop is undoubtedly very expensive. Compared to the function and power you can get from the DELL XPS 15, it’s hard to justify paying nearly $2500 for the Surface Book 2. Its detachable screen, supported by a fulcrum hinge, also comes at a price. It makes the laptop a bit bulky at one end when it’s folded. This in turn can make day-to-day handling a bit more tricky than it has to be.</p><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If you’re searching for a good laptop to help you improve the quality of your videos in 2018, look no further than these 3. They have all the power, function, and storage capacity you need to handle any project with ease. Just be mindful of your budget and consider which extras are worth the expense. Go for the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar if customizing your workflow is a priority. Opt for the Dell XPS 15 if you want the best combination of display quality and graphics processing. Finally, consider the Surface Book 2 if you need the flexibility of a 2-in-1 device.</p><p> What do you think is the best laptop for video editing?</p><h2 id="Equip-Your-Laptop-with-the-Best-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#Equip-Your-Laptop-with-the-Best-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Equip Your Laptop with the Best Video Editing Software"></a>Equip Your Laptop with the Best Video Editing Software</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-5"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-5" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>This article lists the 3 <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best laptops for video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2018.</p><p>Whether you’re an industry professional or an avid YouTuber, you know how important it is to produce quality videos consistently.</p><p>The quality of the videos you create will depend on your creativity, the editing software you use, and the hardware that software is installed on.

And as you probably know, it can be tough to work fast and get good results when your hardware or laptop isn’t strong enough to power your software properly and allow you to work at the pace you want.</p><p>The best laptops for video editing in 2018 have three things in common. First, they have top-of-the-line display technology for color accuracy, color depth, and clarity. Next, they have discrete (dedicated) Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) with accompanying RAM to enable them to handle video processing fast without compromising other system functions. And finally, they have Intel core i7 CPU processors and Solid-State Drives (SSD) for faster overall performance.</p><h2 id="THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018-3"><a href="#THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018-3" class="headerlink" title="THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018"></a>THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018</h2><p>The top 3 laptops below are quite impressive. They have the right mix of power and function that video editing requires.</p><ol><li><a href="#macbook">MacBook Pro With Touch Bar</a></li><li><a href="#dell">Dell XPS 15</a></li><li><a href="#microsoft">Microsoft Surface Book 2</a></li></ol><h3 id="1-MACBOOK-PRO-WITH-TOUCH-BAR-3"><a href="#1-MACBOOK-PRO-WITH-TOUCH-BAR-3" class="headerlink" title="1.MACBOOK PRO WITH TOUCH BAR"></a>1.MACBOOK PRO WITH TOUCH BAR</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-pro-touch-bar.jpg"                      alt="Macbook pro touch bar"                ></p><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $1500 - $1800</p><p><strong>SYSTEM SPECS:</strong></p><p>CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor</p><p>GRAPHICS: Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB memory – 560 with 4GB memory</p><p>RAM: 16GB</p><p>SCREEN: 15.4” Retina Display</p><p>RES: 2880 x 1800px</p><p>STORAGE: 128 – 256GB SSD</p><p><strong>PROS</strong></p><ol><li>OLED Touch Bar</li><li>Thunderbolt 3 ports</li><li>Large Trackpad</li></ol><p> <strong>CONS:</strong></p><ol><li>No other input ports available besides Thunderbolt 3</li><li>Expensive</li></ol><p> The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the best video editing laptop produced by Apple. It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.</p><p>Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.</p><h3 id="2-DELL-XPS-15-3"><a href="#2-DELL-XPS-15-3" class="headerlink" title="2. DELL XPS 15"></a>2. DELL XPS 15</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-xps-15.jpg"                      alt="Dell XPS 15"                ></p><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $999 - $1300</p><p><strong>SYSTEM SPECS:</strong></p><p>CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor</p><p>GRAPHICS: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050</p><p>RAM: 8 - 16GB</p><p>SCREEN: 15.6”</p><p>RES: FHD - 4k UHD 3840 x 2160px</p><p>STORAGE: 256GB – 1TB SSD</p><p><strong>PROS</strong></p><ol><li>4k InfinityEdge display</li><li>Good battery life</li><li>Has multiple input ports</li></ol><p> <strong>CONS:</strong></p><ol><li>Webcam is oddly positioned</li></ol><p>The Dell XPS 15 is one laptop that hits the sweet spot for many videographers. It’s considered the closest competitor to the MacBook Pro reviewed above. In fact, many would argue that it tops the MacBook Pro when it comes to speed, color accuracy, and color depth. Its 15.6” screen has very thin bezels for minimal distraction and immersive work experience. At 4K resolution and displaying a wide range of the sRGB gamut, video editing with the Dell XPS 15 promises to be both smooth and enjoyable.</p><p>The Dell XPS 15 is certainly more affordable, while still delivering excellent graphics performance. It features an Intel i7 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics processor. This makes it remarkably fast for video editing, as well as energy-efficient. People who work with different input devices will also like that this laptop has legacy adapters (USB, HDMI, ethernet) alongside a USB type C port.</p><p>The biggest downside to the Dell XPS 15 laptop is its oddly positioned webcam. It feels awkward and can be an inconvenience to use since you’ll have to adjust your position significantly while making video calls or recording for your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2-3"><a href="#3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2-3" class="headerlink" title="3. MICROSOFT SURFACE BOOK 2"></a>3. MICROSOFT SURFACE BOOK 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-surface-book.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Surface Book"                ></p><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $1499 - $2499</p><p><strong>SYSTEM SPECS:</strong></p><p>CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor</p><p>GRAPHICS: Intel HD 620 or Nvidia GTX 1050 &#x2F; GTX 1060</p><p>RAM: 16GB</p><p>SCREEN: 15.0”</p><p>RES: 3240 x 2160px</p><p>STORAGE: 256GB, 512GB – 1TB SSD</p><p><strong>PROS</strong></p><ol><li>Detachable screen</li><li>Has multiple input ports (USB Type-A, USB Type-C, SD card reader)</li><li>Works with a Stylus</li></ol><p> <strong>CONS:</strong></p><ol><li>Expensive</li><li>Fulcrum hinge</li></ol><p>The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is a laptop and a tablet thanks to its detachable screen. At a resolution of 3240 x 2160px, its screen is nearly 4k and can handle Full HD and HD footage with ease. Add to this its capacity to show a considerable portion of the sRGB gamut and its easy-to-use stylus and you can see why this 2-in-1 combo from Microsoft is one of the top 3 laptops for video editing in 2018.</p><p>Surface Book 2 also has the right combination of power and storage capacity that video editing requires. It boasts a state-of-the-art NVIDIA graphics processor and an Intel i7 processor for a smooth workflow no matter the size or level of detail involved in your video editing project.</p><p>On the downside, this laptop is undoubtedly very expensive. Compared to the function and power you can get from the DELL XPS 15, it’s hard to justify paying nearly $2500 for the Surface Book 2. Its detachable screen, supported by a fulcrum hinge, also comes at a price. It makes the laptop a bit bulky at one end when it’s folded. This in turn can make day-to-day handling a bit more tricky than it has to be.</p><h2 id="CONCLUSION-3"><a href="#CONCLUSION-3" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If you’re searching for a good laptop to help you improve the quality of your videos in 2018, look no further than these 3. They have all the power, function, and storage capacity you need to handle any project with ease. Just be mindful of your budget and consider which extras are worth the expense. Go for the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar if customizing your workflow is a priority. Opt for the Dell XPS 15 if you want the best combination of display quality and graphics processing. Finally, consider the Surface Book 2 if you need the flexibility of a 2-in-1 device.</p><p> What do you think is the best laptop for video editing?</p><h2 id="Equip-Your-Laptop-with-the-Best-Video-Editing-Software-3"><a href="#Equip-Your-Laptop-with-the-Best-Video-Editing-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="Equip Your Laptop with the Best Video Editing Software"></a>Equip Your Laptop with the Best Video Editing Software</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-telepresence-seminar-capture-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Telepresence Seminar Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-essential-guide-to-using-finalcut-pro-in-youtube-editing/"><u>2024 Approved The Essential Guide to Using FinalCut Pro in YouTube Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-from-your-realme-narzo-n53-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide on Using ADB and Fastboot to Remove FRP Lock from your Realme Narzo N53</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-exploring-profit-sharing-in-youtube-short-creation/"><u>In 2024, Exploring Profit Sharing in YouTube Short Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-graphical-forecast-the-dominant-23-social-themes/"><u>In 2024, Graphical Forecast The Dominant '23 Social Themes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-changeadd-location-filters-on-snapchat-for-your-oppo-find-x7-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change/Add Location Filters on Snapchat For your Oppo Find X7 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/miniature-music-menus-actors-in-audio-world-for-2024/"><u>Miniature Music Menus Actors in Audio World for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/navigating-facebooks-video-evolution-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Facebook’s Video Evolution for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/understanding-the-windows-10-power-and-battery-status-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Understanding the Windows 10 Power & Battery Status: A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/unleashing-your-cameras-potential-with-top-rated-drones-gimbals-for-2024/"><u>Unleashing Your Camera's Potential with Top-Rated Drones Gimbals for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If Outriders keeps crashing your PC, you should check if your graphics driver is up-to-date. If not, definitely update it now.</p><p>There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:</p><p><strong>Option 1 – Manually</strong> – GPU manufacturers will regularly optimize their graphics drivers for the latest titles. To get them, you need to go to the driver section of your GPU manufacturer:</p><ul><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" >AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" >NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li></ul><p> Find the correct driver that’s compatible with your system and download it manually. Upon completion, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.</p><p><strong>Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and install Driver Easy.</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the <strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> A product that’s over a decade old typically doesn’t hold up very well, but with Microsoft’s Flight Simulator X, that isn’t necessarily the case. Originally released way back in 2006, Flight Simulator X was the pinnacle of flight sim software, packing in tons of content, interesting new integration with real-world weather and locales, and the most realistic immersion around. Thirteen years later, the game remains one of the most-played flight simulators and continues to get support despite the original studio being closed.</p><p> So how does this legendary flight simulator hold up today? It’s not without its flaws, but the experience is still a solid one. Check out our review here and see for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uwjre5Sam8ge-OfnA-CJEUdp8Vo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW840502MicrosoftFlightSimX_02-308281f4a45a45439f265538706d4f33.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144309/7443" target="_top" id="2144309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144309/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Please-insert-disc-1"><a href="#Setup-Process-Please-insert-disc-1" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Please insert disc 1"></a><strong>Setup Process: Please insert disc 1</strong></h2><p> Setting up a game this old isn’t quite as easy as a modern game, but it’s not a terrible process overall. Now your particular setup will vary a bit, but it should be mostly the same.</p><p> Thirteen years later, the game remains one of the most-played flight simulators and continues to get support despite the original studio being closed.</p><p> For our review, we purchased the good old box set of CDs to install, but you can also get the game online from a distributor like Steam if you don’t want to mess with discs. The Steam version was released back in 2015 and is largely the same, with perhaps a more streamlined setup.</p><p> We began this process by setting up our external DVD drive, popping in the first disc and then running through the on-screen steps. Ensure you’ve got at least 30 GB of storage space available before beginning this step.</p><p> As you progress, the installer will have you swap out discs as they complete individually until you reach the end. Once there, you’ll also need to activate your new software with the key found inside the case. Since this is the Gold Edition, we also needed to run through the same setup process for the Accelerator Expansion Pack that adds additional content.</p><p> After everything is properly installed and ready to go, you can either open up the base game or the expansion pack, which will give you a host of options to choose from to set up your first flight.</p><p> For the Steam version, simply install the software through the client and it’ll do all of the above, minus the discs.</p><p> In addition to setting up the software itself, many people use a HOTAS (which means “hands on throttle-and-stick”) to get more immersion with flight sims like Flight Simulator X. Because these are so commonly used, we’ll run through a setup for these as well.</p><p> The addition of a HOTAS also really adds to the experience and immersion of the game, and we highly recommend picking one up if you can.</p><p> We chose to go with the Thrustmaster T16000M FCS HOTAS, including the added pedals, which is one of the more popular options that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. To get your new HOTAS installed, simply plug everything into your computer, connect the pedals, and Windows should recognize the peripherals and set them up. Once they’re ready, you can go into your settings in FSX and fine-tune things, map the buttons and functions to whatever custom functions you prefer, and jump into a game with your new HOTAS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/q7UBmrCRA6IrC6gs4BrRYIfrWRc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW840502MicrosoftFlightSimX_03-a1872076dd974dc1a989684c97e2d45f.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Dated-but-still-solid"><a href="#Gameplay-Dated-but-still-solid" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Dated, but still solid"></a><strong>Gameplay: Dated, but still solid</strong></h2><p> Given that FSX is now quite old, the gameplay still holds up for the most part, but feels somewhat dated in certain areas. Because this game comes complete with all the original content and expansions, there’s a daunting amount of content to sift through, which keeps replayability high.</p><p> With over 24,000 airports, vehicles ranging from jumbo jets to helicopters, fighter jets, hot air balloons, various weather options, and more, there is a lot of stuff to play around with in the game. No matter what setup you go with, there’s definitely something for everyone here.</p><p> Flight Simulator X is not without its flaws, but the experience is still a solid one.</p><p> Aside from environments and vehicles, there’s also a large swathe of preset missions to test your skills, including basic tutorials for newcomers just getting started. While some of them may be a bit dull for those seeking high-adrenaline activities, like simply flying a plane from one airport to another, Microsoft has also done a great job of including some fun missions that diverge from the real-world stuff. Some of these missions include things like landing a plane on a moving bus, exploring Area 51 or participating in high-speed stunt races with an announcer hyping things up.</p><p> Each of these scenarios offers fun experiences ranging from ultra-realistic simulations to arcadey missions for quick bursts of fun, but all of them will test your skills as a pilot. The sheer amount of gameplay options should keep you entertained for hundreds of hours as you increase the difficulty and challenge yourself with each new mission. The gameplay feels a little dated, but we had no real hiccups during our tests, and it proved to be a smooth experience.</p><p> In addition to singleplayer experiences, you can also play FSX online with other players from all over the world. While this can sometimes lead to “interesting” encounters to say the least (lots of kamikazes), the community is still pretty active with a player base comprised of amateurs just messing around and those who take things a little more seriously, mimicking more realistic gameplay. There’s even an option to play as an air traffic controller if you want to try your hand at one of the most stressful jobs in the world.</p><p> Flying just about any aircraft feels smooth and allows you to get as complicated as you want, controlling every aspect of the vehicle with realistic gauges and effects, or streamlined controls for a more basic, simplified experience.</p><p> Some of these missions include things like landing a plane on a moving bus, exploring Area 51 or participating in high-speed stunt races with an announcer hyping things up.</p><p> To further the gameplay options, there is also an excellent modding community surrounding FSX. With mods, you can really open things up by adding custom planes and other aircraft, new locations, and player-made missions.</p><p> The addition of a HOTAS also really adds to the experience and immersion of the game, and we highly recommend picking one up if you can. During our testing, the Thrustmaster T16000M FCS paired quite nicely with FSX and allowed us to custom tailor controls to our liking. The ability to pilot your virtual aircraft with somewhat realistic peripherals definitely adds a nice level of detail to the gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oUI0sMg_D0Wrf9Maq7QACUvz4sI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW840502MicrosoftFlightSimX_04-a52be5fb83e54c04acfc68a9b28af39d-2c15555da01247beb7532ce91594646d.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043618/7443" target="_top" id="2043618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043618/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Like-traveling-back-in-time"><a href="#Graphics-Like-traveling-back-in-time" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Like traveling back in time"></a><strong>Graphics: Like traveling back in time</strong></h2><p> It’s no surprise that a game made all the way back in 2006 feels old when it comes to graphics. You won’t be impressed by the lackluster textures, lighting effects or animations in FSX if you’ve never played it in the past.</p><p> That said, the graphics certainly aren’t so awful that the game is unplayable. In fact, they’re pretty damn good considering how old FSX actually is. Sure, they won’t blow you away, but you can also play the game on just about any modern computer.</p><p> Aircraft textures on the outside are perhaps the highlight of the graphics, but the ground, buildings, cockpit and controls don’t exactly look amazing.</p><p> Cranking up the graphics to the max and jumping into the cockpit of your aircraft of choice is still enjoyable, with everything easily readable and sharp. The framerate is smooth throughout and doesn’t drastically change like some modern games, meaning your experience will at least be stable.</p><p> Aircraft textures on the outside are perhaps the highlight of this area, but the ground, buildings, cockpit, and controls don’t exactly look amazing. You can, however, download some mods to add HD resolutions to things that will help remedy this, and they’re pretty easy to install.</p><h2 id="Price-Cheap-unless-you-want-the-DLC"><a href="#Price-Cheap-unless-you-want-the-DLC" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap unless you want the DLC"></a><strong>Price: Cheap unless you want the DLC</strong></h2><p> So with a 13-year-old game like FSX, you’d expect the price to be quite low, right? While FSX can typically be found for around $25 on Steam, and you can frequently find it on sale for just $5. This gets you the Gold Edition that includes all the original content and the Acceleration expansion. So for the price, it’s pretty fair—especially considering how many hundreds of hours you can get from the base game.</p><p> For Steam users, however, the game has an insane amount of DLC options. While most of these aren’t necessary to have, they can really add up if you’re someone who likes to have it all. Currently, the Steam version has almost $2,000 worth of DLC, but no one really needs to get all that to have a good time with FSX, so choose what you want, or simply enjoy the base game and download mods to supplement the content for free.</p><p> We should also mention here that there are plans in place for FSX to finally get a true successor in the near future with Microsoft’s Flight Simulator 2020 just on the horizon, so it may be worth it to hold off.</p><h2 id="Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-X-vs-X-Plane-11-Global-Flight-Simulator"><a href="#Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-X-vs-X-Plane-11-Global-Flight-Simulator" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator X vs. X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"></a><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator X vs. X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator</strong></h2><p> The biggest competitor out to FSX is another fan-favorite—X-Plane 11. While it does feel a little unfair to compare such a new game against FSX, the two are perhaps the best available in the market at this time. The newest flight sim from Microsoft is a much better direct competitor.</p><p> The biggest difference between these two is that X-Plane released in 2017, and will undoubtedly look much better, feature more modern controls, animations, and include updated gameplay for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >current-gen systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you’re purely looking for the latest and greatest in flight simulator software, X-Plane will be an easy pick for you.</p><p> However, there’s definitely something to be said for the longevity of FSX. The game continues to get support and has an active community, with thousands of mods for further customization. While X-Plane might be the current-gen favorite, it won’t come close to the massive amount of content FSX can bring to the table. The trade-off here is an older game with dated visuals, but if that doesn’t bother you, FSX might bring you more hours of total gaming.

Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg"                      alt="Consistent Layout"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094419/7443" target="_top" id="2094419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094419/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Use-Your-Face-3"><a href="#2-Use-Your-Face-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Your Face"></a><strong>2. Use Your Face</strong></h2><p>People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out more tips like this here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic-3"><a href="#3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic"></a>3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic</h2><p>Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.</p><p>Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Your-Text-Huge-3"><a href="#4-Make-Your-Text-Huge-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Your Text Huge"></a>4. Make Your Text Huge</h2><p>If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free-3"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep it Clutter-Free"></a>5. Keep it Clutter-Free</h2><p>It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.</p><p>A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.</p><p> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >For even more tips on making great YouTube thumbnails, click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Use these tips to make video thumbnails for YouTube, and tell us what kind of results you get!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/2106658/12108" target="_top" id="2106658">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-2106658" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/2106658/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Watch-9-Free-Full-Length-Christmas-Movies-On-YouTube"><a href="#Watch-9-Free-Full-Length-Christmas-Movies-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Watch 9 Free Full Length Christmas Movies On YouTube"></a>Watch 9 Free Full Length Christmas Movies On YouTube</h2><h1 id="Watch-9-Free-Full-Length-Christmas-Movies-On-Youtube"><a href="#Watch-9-Free-Full-Length-Christmas-Movies-On-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Watch 9 Free Full Length Christmas Movies On Youtube"></a>Watch 9 Free Full Length Christmas Movies On Youtube</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>If you are looking for Christmas entertainment this season you may be quick to look towards a provider like iTunes or Netflix to give you some excellent Christmas movies.

It’s hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.</p><p>Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.</p><p><strong>View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:</strong> be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube’s Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down.

Bots automatically add views to your videos.</p><p>Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Why Use a YouTube View Bot?"></a>Why Use a YouTube View Bot?</h2><p>Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as ‘social proof’ of the video’s quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don’t have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.</p><p>Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.</p><h2 id="What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do"><a href="#What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?"></a>What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?</h2><p>The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.</p><p>You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.</p><p>Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.</p><h2 id="Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?"></a>Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?</h2><p> <strong>Yes.</strong></p><p>Bots are against YouTube’s TOS, especially for partners using AdSense (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube’s partnership program here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you’ve used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.</p><p>The biggest danger isn’t YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don’t persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube’s algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven’t watched them. The algorithm interprets that as ‘the people clicking on this don’t like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.</p><p>If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views"></a>Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views</h2><h3 id="1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel"><a href="#1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.</p><p>Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.</p><p><strong>View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:</strong> be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube’s Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down. If you still wish to learn more about bots, keep reading.

Bots automatically add views to your videos.</p><p>Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot-3"><a href="#Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Use a YouTube View Bot?"></a>Why Use a YouTube View Bot?</h2><p>Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as ‘social proof’ of the video’s quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don’t have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.</p><p>Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.</p><h2 id="What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do-3"><a href="#What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do-3" class="headerlink" title="What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?"></a>What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?</h2><p>The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.</p><p>You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.</p><p>Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.</p><h2 id="Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot-3"><a href="#Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot-3" class="headerlink" title="Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?"></a>Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?</h2><p> <strong>Yes.</strong></p><p>Bots are against YouTube’s TOS, especially for partners using AdSense (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube’s partnership program here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you’ve used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.</p><p>The biggest danger isn’t YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don’t persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube’s algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven’t watched them. The algorithm interprets that as ‘the people clicking on this don’t like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.</p><p>If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views-3"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views"></a>Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel-3"><a href="#1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe.

The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage.

Benefits of Transcribing YouTube Videos</h2><p>You may need video transcriptions for several reasons, such as analyzing the summary of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you <strong>transcribe a YouTube video</strong>, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:</p><ul><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></li></ul><p>When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>Accent</strong></li></ul><p>If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Repurposing on Blogs</strong></li></ul><p>If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Transcription FAQs"></a>YouTube Video Transcription FAQs</h3><h4 id="1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text"><a href="#1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="1.

We’ll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:</p><h3 id="Video-length"><a href="#Video-length" class="headerlink" title="Video length"></a>Video length</h3><p>One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length.

It would be best if you tailored the ad to what’s happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you’re looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.</p><h3 id="Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives"><a href="#Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives" class="headerlink" title="Number of clicks each ad receives"></a>Number of clicks each ad receives</h3><p>The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes.

The ad should also be timely.

We have added the three <strong>sample videos</strong> from the library of Wondershare Filmora itself. Adjust them in the timeline as per your requirements.</p><p>After doing all the essential editing functions, click on the <strong>Effects tab</strong> given at the upper-left corner. Simply type the word Old in the Search tab.</p><p>The Old Video filter will immediately appear in the list of filters. Tap the <strong>“+”</strong> icon in Old Video filter to add to the timeline.

Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and explore five Black &amp; White filters available. Each of these filters is quite different and must be applied accordingly. Check the aesthetic of your video clip before any filter application to retro videos.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the Sun Kissed or Sepia Tone Rise Filters to the video clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>There are various other categories of filters you can apply, such as Retro, Sun Kissed, and Sepia Tone, etc. The features of Filmora also present several subcategories such as Faux Film or Shake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-4.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>On the other hand, the subcategory of Sepia Tone features Sun-Kissed &amp; Rise Filters to stimulate sepia-tinted texture and recreate the old visual style.

We have typed Ash in the Search bar, and you can see the filter below. These filters are essential to desaturate the video with preset contrast, brightness, or exposure values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-6.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Then, we have combined the black &amp; white filter with an overlay of Film Reel Horizontal. It will help you sell the effect and make the video look more authentic. However, the only application of Black &amp; White or Ash &amp; Willow filters is not going to make any creative thing in terms of vintage videos. You have to mix overlays with features such as Random Dust or Film Reel Horizontal.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Apply Black &amp; White and Old Film Color Correction Presets to the video</p><p>You can also access the Advanced color correction Tab of Filmora from the Color button. It also features Preset and Adjusts Tabs to desaturate footage. The Preset presents a variety of options, including Black &amp; White and Old Film.

Use color grading, as we have discussed above. They help to provide the ultimate old-school effect.</li><li>Always keep low saturation settings for shooting vintage videos. Take control over Saturation, Hue, and <strong>Luminance</strong> of video.</li><li>Add overlays and respective filters to recreate a required vintage look. You must add things that dust, scratch, and grain the heck out from the video that you have created.</li><li>Lower the frame rate or FPS to create an excellent vintage look. You can make it to 18 or 14 FPS depending upon the aesthetic requirements.</li><li>Keep an eye on black and white filters you have used. It’s because more of a black and white can ruin the actual vintage experience.</li></ul><h3 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>So, this is an ultimate tutorial on the creation of vintage videos.

The Sun Kissed filter presents brown and red colors to give that warm image atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Desaturate Video Clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-5.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Now, you need to desaturate the video clip with Ash &amp; Willow filters. We have typed Ash in the Search bar, and you can see the filter below. These filters are essential to desaturate the video with preset contrast, brightness, or exposure values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-6.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Then, we have combined the black &amp; white filter with an overlay of Film Reel Horizontal. It will help you sell the effect and make the video look more authentic. However, the only application of Black &amp; White or Ash &amp; Willow filters is not going to make any creative thing in terms of vintage videos. You have to mix overlays with features such as Random Dust or Film Reel Horizontal.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Apply Black &amp; White and Old Film Color Correction Presets to the video</p><p>You can also access the Advanced color correction Tab of Filmora from the Color button. It also features Preset and Adjusts Tabs to desaturate footage. The Preset presents a variety of options, including Black &amp; White and Old Film.

Don’t go too crazy about reduction as 20%-30% saturation level is more than enough.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098704/14409" target="_top" id="2098704">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098704" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098704/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video-3"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?"></a>How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</h2><p>What you need to get started as both beginner and professional is Wondershare Filmora Video Editor.

We have added the three <strong>sample videos</strong> from the library of Wondershare Filmora itself. Adjust them in the timeline as per your requirements.</p><p>After doing all the essential editing functions, click on the <strong>Effects tab</strong> given at the upper-left corner. Simply type the word Old in the Search tab.</p><p>The Old Video filter will immediately appear in the list of filters. Tap the <strong>“+”</strong> icon in Old Video filter to add to the timeline. Drag its ends right or left to adjust the duration.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply White &amp; Black Filters</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-2.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139110/17108" target="_top" id="2139110">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139110" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139110/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The second step is to apply the Black &amp; White filters. Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and explore five Black &amp; White filters available. Each of these filters is quite different and must be applied accordingly. Check the aesthetic of your video clip before any filter application to retro videos.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the Sun Kissed or Sepia Tone Rise Filters to the video clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>There are various other categories of filters you can apply, such as Retro, Sun Kissed, and Sepia Tone, etc. The features of Filmora also present several subcategories such as Faux Film or Shake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-4.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>On the other hand, the subcategory of Sepia Tone features Sun-Kissed &amp; Rise Filters to stimulate sepia-tinted texture and recreate the old visual style. The Sun Kissed filter presents brown and red colors to give that warm image atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Desaturate Video Clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-5.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now, you need to desaturate the video clip with Ash &amp; Willow filters. We have typed Ash in the Search bar, and you can see the filter below. These filters are essential to desaturate the video with preset contrast, brightness, or exposure values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-6.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Then, we have combined the black &amp; white filter with an overlay of Film Reel Horizontal. It will help you sell the effect and make the video look more authentic. However, the only application of Black &amp; White or Ash &amp; Willow filters is not going to make any creative thing in terms of vintage videos. You have to mix overlays with features such as Random Dust or Film Reel Horizontal.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Apply Black &amp; White and Old Film Color Correction Presets to the video</p><p>You can also access the Advanced color correction Tab of Filmora from the Color button. It also features Preset and Adjusts Tabs to desaturate footage. The Preset presents a variety of options, including Black &amp; White and Old Film. You just need to right-click the particular preset and select the Apply option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-advance-color-correction.jpg"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><h2 id="Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out-3"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out"></a>Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</h2><p>Following the helpful tips would assist you in creating awesome retro videos.</p><ul><li>You can use various vintage apps such as <strong>Retro VHS</strong>, <strong>RTRO Camera</strong>, <strong>8mm</strong>, <strong>Camcorder</strong>, <strong>VSCO</strong>, etc. Or, despite using these limited apps, you can directly use our preferred video editing software called <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.</li><li>If you use a specific vintage camera, keep it on low highlights and low contrasts. Use color grading, as we have discussed above. They help to provide the ultimate old-school effect.</li><li>Always keep low saturation settings for shooting vintage videos. Take control over Saturation, Hue, and <strong>Luminance</strong> of video.</li><li>Add overlays and respective filters to recreate a required vintage look. You must add things that dust, scratch, and grain the heck out from the video that you have created.</li><li>Lower the frame rate or FPS to create an excellent vintage look. You can make it to 18 or 14 FPS depending upon the aesthetic requirements.</li><li>Keep an eye on black and white filters you have used. It’s because more of a black and white can ruin the actual vintage experience.</li></ul><h3 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>So, this is an ultimate tutorial on the creation of vintage videos.
