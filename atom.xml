Resources like filters are also very accessible.</p><p>Everything you do in Spark starts with clicking on an element in the template.

That said, it can take up to 10 days for electronic wire payments to be received.</p><p>In addition to reaching the payment threshold, be sure that you have no payment hold on your AdSense account. A payment hold can cause your earnings to be withheld even if it has reached the payment threshold.</p><p>To avoid a payment hold, be sure to provide the necessary tax information, verify your identity and your address, make sure the bank account linked to your AdSense is verified, and make sure you have not violated any of YouTube’s guidelines and community rules.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Depending on your vlogging skills and the nature of your content (some types of videos get more attention than others), it can take a while for you to be eligible for monetization.

Just focus on creating a YouTube channel people will want to watch.

About a month ago, you had to have 10,000 lifetime views on your YouTube channel to qualify for monetization. However, earlier this year, Google changed their eligibility requirements and made them even tougher.</p><p>As of February 20, 2018, YouTube channels need to have accumulated 4000 hours of ‘watch time’ over the past 12 months and no less than 1000 subscribers to qualify for monetization. If you do not meet these requirements you cannot join the YouTube Partner Program and monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>So, the first step to successful monetization on YouTube is to actually grow your channel. You need to create videos that will attract viewers and engage your audience. You also need to get people to subscribe because this is really what will grow your YouTube channel over time.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Monetization-for-Your-YouTube-Channel-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Monetization-for-Your-YouTube-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Monetization for Your YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Monetization for Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>Here’s the step-by-step process for monetizing your YouTube Channel, for those who are qualified.</p><ol><li>Log in to your YouTube account.</li><li>Find your account icon in the top right corner. Click it to find the ‘Creator Studio’ button.</li><li>Click the ‘Creator Studio’ button.</li><li>Click the ‘Channel’ option in the left side menu.</li><li>You’ll see a drop-down menu under ‘Channel’. Click on ‘Status and Features’. This is actually the first option on the menu. It should open by default once you click the ‘Channel’ button.</li><li>Look through the ‘Status and Features’ page and click the ‘Enable’ button beside monetization.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt=" enable youtube monetization"                ></p><ol><li>Clicking the ‘Enable’ button should lead you to another page where the guidelines for monetization are explained. Take the time to read through the guidelines and understand the dos and don’ts of YouTube monetization.</li><li>Once you’ve looked through the guidelines, click the ‘Enable my account’ button to proceed. This will lead you to a page where you’ll be prompted to join the YouTube Partner Program.</li><li>Read through the YouTube Partner Program terms, check the appropriate boxes, and click the ‘accept’ button.</li><li>You’ll be prompted to link an AdSense account.</li><li>Connect an existing AdSense account if you have one or create a new one.</li><li>Once you’re done linking an AdSense account, you’ll be redirected to YouTube. There, select the type of ads you want to run under ‘Monetization Preferences’.</li><li>Click the submit button and wait to find out if your account is approved for monetization.</li></ol><p>According to YouTube, it can take up to a week for a decision to be reached on your application.</p><p>YouTube will not review your monetization application until you’ve met their eligibility criteria. Even then, your application may be declined if your videos do not follow the community guidelines (i.e. channels which simply repost content from other channels will not be monetized).</p><p>Not all videos can be monetized. While there are legal ways to create videos consisting of imagery and footage belonging to others, be aware that such videos are not always eligible for monetization. YouTube will only monetize videos that you own. So, posting videos which do not belong to you or which include copyrighted content can cause your monetization application to be declined.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Linking-Your-Bank-Account-To-Your-AdSense-Account-3"><a href="#Part-3-Linking-Your-Bank-Account-To-Your-AdSense-Account-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Linking Your Bank Account To Your AdSense Account"></a>Part 3: Linking Your Bank Account To Your AdSense Account</h2><p>AdSense offers a variety of payment options including mailed checks and Western Union transfers. However, these options may not be available to you depending on where you’re based. AdSense does make payments through electronic wire transfer (EFT – Electronic funds transfer) to virtually every country in the world, and this is the preferred payment option for most people.</p><p>To have your earnings deposited directly into your account through EFT, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide for linking your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><ol><li>Log in to AdSense via: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start" >www.google.com/adsense/start <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Click the ‘Settings’ button in the left panel menu</li><li>Under ‘Settings’, click ‘Payments’.</li><li>On the ‘Payments’ page, click ‘Manage payment options’.</li><li>Click ‘Add payment method’.</li><li>Next, you’ll be prompted to add your bank account details. In general, you will be asked to provide the following:  <ol><li><em>Name on the account &#x2F; account holder’s name</em>  </li><li><em>Bank account number</em>  </li><li><em>Bank name</em>  </li><li><em>Bank SWIFT code</em>  </li><li><em>Depending on where you are based, additional information may be required.</em></li></ol></li><li>Ensure that the name on your AdSense account matches the name on the bank account you provide.

You may wish to set a higher threshold but as a rule, earnings below the $100 will not be processed for payment (you will still receive the money, it will just keep adding up until it gets to $100 and then you’ll be paid).</p><p>Also, bear in mind that AdSense follows a monthly payment cycle.

Like most streaming services, you get family and student plans. YouTube Premium costs your $6.99 monthly subscription for students’ plans. You, however, need to verify that you are a student. A family plan comes at $17.99 per month, where you can add up to five members.

While YouTube Premium is a paid subscription, YouTube TV is a live streaming service. Let’s explore more differences.</p><h5 id="What-is-included"><a href="#What-is-included" class="headerlink" title="What is included"></a>What is included</h5><p>If you subscribe to YouTube Premium, then you unlock other streaming features. These include watching YouTube without ads on its apps, managing offline viewing, playing your videos in the background, and getting YouTube Music, among others.</p><p>You can watch various channels over the internet with YouTube TV, live. It offers you close to 90 channels cutting across lifestyle, news, entertainment, sports, etc. Likewise, you can stream live broadcasts from top networks like NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. It will also splash your screen with news channels from BBC America, CNN, FOX News, etc.</p><h5 id="Cost"><a href="#Cost" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h5><p>When it comes to pricing, YouTube Premium costs $11.00 per month with a free, one-month trial for new subscribers. It also has different plans for students and families. On the other hand, YouTube TV starts at $64.99 per month. However, first-time subscribers can get a free offer of up to one week at no cost. This rate may seem high, but it is competitive with other live TV streaming services.</p><h5 id="Accessibility"><a href="#Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h5><p>YouTube TV is readily available on the web, mobile platforms, and media streaming devices like Fire TV and Chromecast. You can also download the YouTube TV app to enjoy it on players like game consoles and PlayStations. For YouTube Premium, you’ll easily access it by subscription.</p><p>However, there are areas where both YouTube TV and YouTube Premium overlap. Both will let you watch YouTube Originals.</p><p>You will also enjoy your videos without adverts interruption. Additionally, it would be best to have an internet connection to stream your videos before downloading. And after downloading and saving your files, you can stream them offline on YouTube Premium.</p><p>So, which is better?</p><p>YouTube Premium subscribers think it’s the better choice. For one, if you like entertainment from services like Hulu, Netflix, Disney, and much more, then YouTube Premium has you covered than YouTube TV.</p><h5 id="Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries"><a href="#Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?"></a>Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?</h5><p>● YouTube Premium is not available in some countries. The likely reason is that those countries’ laws prevent it from being offered.</p><p>● But worry less, you can still access YouTube Premium even if it’s not available in your country. You can switch to an alternative county and stream videos.</p><ul><li>Make a quick switch by first clicking the “Country” button on the bottom of the YouTube homepage. Here, you’ll view various available countries where YouTube Premium is accessible.</li><li>Then click any country of choice to switch to. It will give you that country’s YouTube version.</li><li>You can also change your language if it presents a foreign language video and description. Just click on the “Language” button on the page.</li><li>Finally, access and play any YouTube premium video virtually from the country you switched to.</li></ul><h2 id="Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to"><a href="#Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to" class="headerlink" title="Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?"></a>Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</h2><p>Even with the lack of YouTube Premium annual subscription, it still beats all odds to subscribe to this streaming service.</p><h4 id="1-Offline-playback"><a href="#1-Offline-playback" class="headerlink" title="1) Offline playback"></a>1) Offline playback</h4><p>Office playback is one reason why YouTube lovers opt for the Premium subscription. Saving your videos for offline listening gives you more advantages than needing to be online to stream your videos. You can do it by simply checking for the “Download” icon below the video you wish to save on your device for later watching. You are then free to stream your files at any time, on the go!</p><h4 id="2-Free-of-ads-at-last"><a href="#2-Free-of-ads-at-last" class="headerlink" title="2) Free of ads at last"></a>2) Free of ads at last</h4><p>YouTube streaming is much better without ever interacting with adverts. There are no pop-ups with the Premium version, letting you enjoy every bit of your video streaming. Again, such interruptions aren’t healthy for a tutorial session. Without ads, you can fully concentrate on video playing, letting you get quality value for your time.</p><h4 id="3-Get-original-content"><a href="#3-Get-original-content" class="headerlink" title="3) Get original content"></a>3) Get original content</h4><p>By fact, it is clear that this platform lets you interact with high-end artists who dwell on giving original content to their viewers. You’ll get a perfect chance to subscribe to artists who offer content, i.e., exclusive to the paid tier.</p><h4 id="4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free"><a href="#4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free" class="headerlink" title="4) Included Google Play Music for free"></a>4) Included Google Play Music for free</h4><p>It’s a double party for YouTube Premium subscribers. You have the advantage of getting Google Play Music when you subscribe to YouTube Music Premium. More so, the Google Play library gives you tones of music from their library. Combined with YouTube Premium offers, you won’t have any reason not to feel entertained from any genre of choice.</p><h4 id="Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way"><a href="#Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way" class="headerlink" title="Some improvements will go a long way"></a>Some improvements will go a long way</h4><p>Despite all the reasons to subscribe to YouTube Premium, it still needs a minor improvement to perfection.</p><ul><li>The YouTube Premium service’s availability is limited compared to the initial YouTube version. Therefore, some countries prohibit its usage and are only accessible in about 70 countries. Hopefully, it will be available worldwide so that no user is limited.</li><li>YouTube Premium subscription does not give any discounts on any of the subscriptions. And being that it has no yearly subscriptions, the amount remains the same whether you opt for one month or pay it times 12 for the year. There should be some considerations for offers, primarily when you cover the one-year payments.</li><li>Some users feel the price is higher than other streaming services. However, YouTube claims to offer free Google Play music. Perhaps this is the reason for the slight rise.</li><li>This streaming service lacks some extras like rentals and charged station subscriptions. Other features like “lyrics” to the songs have also not been catered for. Likewise, some extra information like the title or genre of the video you watch is not included. These small extras could go a long way if they were to be added.</li><li>YouTube Premium also seems to pay attention to celebrities other than YouTubers. Most originals are not exclusive to Premium subscribers, while you can watch them with ads on a free account.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Amidst the many YouTube subscriptions, YouTube Premium has come a long way. Additionally, it hasn’t covered all the countries just yet. However, it has eliminated the presence of annoying ads that are prominent with the free YouTube service. More so, you get free access to Google Play Music, among other added values. Despite those, the app still needs some improvements in its services to incorporate YouTube Premium subscribers in its walk fully.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>It was formerly known as YouTube Red three years ago when it first launched.

Furthermore, the ephemeral content, the type of content that is available for less than 24 hours, is on the rise, which means that Instagram or Snapchat stories must be considered as a channel for brand promotion in the next year and in years to come.</p><p><strong>Chatbots</strong> represent a significant force on the market since 80% of chatbots can be utilized for providing non-stop services. Some estimations say that up to 30% of all chat conversations on the Internet will be with chatbots as soon as 2018. Despite the rapid automatization of the Internet, influencers still play a large role in online marketing, and they will continue to do so because they can produce a ten-time rise in conversion rates. Over 90% of people who at one point used influencer marketing think that it is an effective marketing technique that almost certainly provides results.</p><p>One force on the market that needs to be reckoned with are <strong>Smartphones</strong>. The amount of time an average internet user spends on social networks from their Smartphone is significantly larger than the amount of time spent on those same networks from a desktop computer. This means that optimizing online content for Smartphones will become even more important in 2018, than it already is.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming Takes the Center Stage</strong>.

Without any further ado, let’s take a look.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP"></a>Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP</h4><p>This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro</h4><p>That’s the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP "                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on <strong>Balance Color</strong> and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="adjust youtube video scale and position"                ></p><ul><li>You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly"><a href="#Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly"></a>Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Upload video to YouTube from FCP"                ></p><p>This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -&gt; Share -&gt; Master File -&gt; Setting -&gt; File -&gt; Share -&gt; YouTube. That’s basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -&gt; Publish and the entire thing is done. That’s all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.</p><p>Check this video tutorial to see how YouTube creators edit their YouTubes videos with Final Cut Pro</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-impressive-display-innovations-top-10-mac-displays-of-the-year/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Impressive Display Innovations - Top 10 Mac Displays of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-the-audio-alchemists-handbook-creating-custom-auditory-alerts-on-android-phones-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Audio Alchemist's Handbook Creating Custom Auditory Alerts on Android Phones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-close-encounters-experiencing-roblox-at-greater-detail/"><u>2024 Approved Close Encounters Experiencing Roblox At Greater Detail</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/1723074226539-experience-cutting-edge-tv-without-breaking-the-bank-with-the-antolink-at-127-a-sophisticated-and-efficient-choice/"><u>Experience Cutting Edge TV Without Breaking the Bank with the Antolink AT-127 - A Sophisticated and Efficient Choice!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-lava-yuva-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Lava Yuva 2? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-volume-normalizers-how-to-normalize-audio-in-videos/"><u>New In 2024, Best Volume Normalizers How to Normalize Audio in Videos?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-elite-dangerous-pc-instability-and-preventing-crashes/"><u>Troubleshooting Elite Dangerous PC Instability and Preventing Crashes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-utorrent-top-7-steps-when-it-stops-working/"><u>Troubleshooting Utorrent: Top 7 Steps When It Stops Working</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-best-practices-for-crafting-viral-instagram-reels-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling the Best Practices for Crafting Viral Instagram Reels for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134501/19576" target="_top" id="2134501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134501/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Shopping for an inexpensive but high-quality 4K TV under $1,000 that won’t take up too much space? The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) ticks all those boxes. Despite its low price, this Roku TV is rich with features that rival more expensive options.</p><p> We tested the TCL 50S425 and were impressed by the ease of setup, picture quality, and user-friendliness of this<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8IJD6mxL-mHDn0MMWWRd5yZERlc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_04-bbd6d026c9ec48df9f12c934b7def674.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward"><a href="#Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lightweight and straightforward"></a><strong>Design: Lightweight and straightforward</strong></h2><p> Smart TVs range in size, typically starting from 32 inches and reaching all the way up to 85 inches and beyond. If you can’t accommodate or don’t want a really large television, the TCL 50-inch Roku TV offers a decent middle ground that will appeal to shoppers who want an apartment or dorm-friendly TV without sacrificing quality.</p><p> In appearance, the TCL 50S425 doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It’s black, rectangular, and slim. It comes with the option of wall-mounting or setting it up on a media console or other surface with the enclosed stand. With the legs attached, the set measures 44 inches wide, 28 inches tall, and 8 inches deep and weighs only 23.6 pounds. While the screen is categorized in the 50-inch class the size of the display is 49.5 inches on a diagonal. This lack of bulky bezels surrounding the screen contributes to the slim profile of this TV.</p><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV.</p><p> The Roku remote complements the streamlined design of the screen. In the style of other Roku remotes, it’s a compact and almost weightless wand-like infrared device with a simple and straightforward layout. We found it easy to hold in one hand and easily access all 20 buttons without having to make any grip adjustments. There are also a handful of shortcut buttons for quick access to Netflix, Hulu, the Roku Channel, and ESPN. As long as you point it directly toward the TV, you shouldn’t have any problems with remote performance, but we did notice an occasional lag here or there when the remote seemed to hang and then perform multiple actions in quick succession.</p><p> There are some unfortunate design quirks. The remote’s directional buttons are quite loud. They don’t require a hard press to activate, but they make an audible clicking sound. This is slightly jarring since the other buttons are nearly silent when pressed. Another drawback is the LED status indicator located in the bottom center of the display. By default this light is always on. You can turn this indicator off, but it will continue to blink and flash during other operations, which we sometimes found distracting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cT13RJhaMjC05v7eMym3vtM8M0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_05-70fc23cf6c2b4a13ac9d46f9372010ef.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Up and running in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Up and running in minutes</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 50-inch TCL Roku TV is a breeze. We opted to forego mounting the television, but the user manual indicates that this model is compatible with a VESA 200 x 200 wall mount with M6 x 12mm screws.</p><p> As directed, we placed the monitor face down on a plush surface and attached the two stand legs using the four MS x 25mm screws. After situating the television on a shelf, we plugged the unit into a wall outlet using the enclosed AC power cord. Once the TV was plugged in, it powered on immediately and displayed the guided setup process. These steps were very straightforward and included first setting a language preference, a network connection, and activating the device. The other critical step with setup involves either signing up for or logging into an existing Roku account.</p><p> Since we already had a Roku account, all of our previously selected channels and apps downloaded to the TV, which just took a few minutes, and then we were free to begin exploring. The amount of additional setup is pretty minimal. By default, you’ll see an HDR notification when you’re viewing HDR-enabled content, but you can turn this off from the settings panel if you like.</p><p> Additionally, if you plan to use a set-top cable box or antenna, the user manual offers straightforward instructions for doing so. You also have the option of enabling the Smart TV experience when you use antenna TV mode. This setting uses automatic content recognition (ACR) to make viewing recommendations based on what you view through your antenna or connected HDMI devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking</strong></h2><p> One of the biggest draws of a 4K TV is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which offers four times the resolution quality of a standard high definition TV. This pixel resolution is also commonly referred to as Ultra HD (UHD). This Roku TV also comes with HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which is commonly bundled with 4K resolution in the newest smart TVs.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR improves image quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by intensifying the contrast between white and black areas on the screen while achieving a solid balance, so nothing looks too dark or too bright. It also broadens the palette of available colors, especially in combination with Wide Color Gamut (WCG).</p><p> One thing we noticed right out of the gate is how vivid 4K content looks. To test the 4K image quality, we started by exploring the 4K Spotlight content. This section includes links to 4K movies, TV, and videos. We found a couple of nature-themed 4K videos on YouTube and were really impressed with what we saw. A video touring Zion National Park looked almost 3D and we practically felt like we were there. The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> Apart from 4K nature videos, we also browsed 4K movies and TV shows through the Amazon Prime app. We found the same appealing mix of crisp picture quality, vibrant colors, and contrast. Even standard high definition shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Prime looked quite good on screen. Though it’s hard to say if there’s a considerable difference, TCL is eager to boast about the power of their 4K Creative Pro upscaling feature which renders regular HD content into 4K-like quality. The bottom line is that HD content looks great across the board, upscaled or not.</p><p> The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> With the handy multi-purpose asterisk button you can alter a number of display settings, and you can access this options menu in the middle of viewing content. Adjusting picture settings doesn’t require exiting an app or pausing whatever you’re watching, which lets you make adjustments and immediately see the result. You can add more vibrancy and contrast to whatever you’re watching, or enable modes like Movie when you’re viewing a film in the evening or with the lights dimmed.</p><p> You can control everything from backlighting to brightness, contrast, and dynamic contrast. This last setting is particularly relevant to HDR content because it helps balance the light and dark settings on your screen so that there’s no excess in either direction. The online user manual does a fine job of explaining some of the advanced picture settings, and even just toggling through the menu on the TV brings up a description of what you’re changing.</p><p> Regular picture mode and the predefined 4K HDR picture settings were on point, which made viewing right out of the box extremely easy and pleasant. We were also pleased by the picture quality from all angles. Getting too close or too far out to the right or left did reveal some shadows and distortion, but only at fairly extreme angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Lv4B9e6LaJSHW7NSl-Braa2vnmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_03-b8155781e440420aa0c6c2bf19f9fe6a.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding</strong></h2><p> While the TCL Roku TV offers impressive picture quality, the sound is less noteworthy. The two built-in 8-watt speakers offer decent volume levels, but there’s no advanced audio settings menu in this model. You do have control over aspects like sound mode and volume mode. The default sound mode is “normal,” which is appropriate for everyday viewing. But you can also select options for higher treble, more bass, movie, or music mode. As for volume modes, you can either turn on leveling, to balance the contrast between lows and highs in audio, or enable night mode, which sets a threshold for how high the volume can go.</p><p> We did notice some issues with what sounded like crackling and extreme lows and highs in dialog and music, though we were able to smooth these issues out by tweaking a few settings.</p><p> In our testing experience in a small room, the internal speakers were more than adequate without the need for additional speakers. If you do want another layer of dimension to your audio, you might consider opting for the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-speakers-and-home-theater-1846770" >wireless speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> designed specifically for Roku TV sets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3AbTZysdVWZbOWuuVGOa56_8c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_02-04183ae8dcd44b778b4da0e7706d5df2.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424533">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424533">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424533%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424533/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive and streamlined"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive and streamlined</strong></h2><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV and a big part of the equation is the operating system. The TCL 50S425 operates on Roku OS 9.1, and it’s extremely user-friendly. Updates are automatic so there’s no manual effort required on your part, and the interface is laid out in a clear and uncomplicated manner.</p><p> The Home screen features all of your apps, which you can arrange and delete with the click of the asterisk button. All the other menus are easy to identify as well. There’s a search page, a streaming channels section, and the settings menu. This clean and straightforward layout may not be the most sophisticated, but it’s easy to use and simplicity is the beauty of this system.</p><p> While the remote doesn’t come with a built-in speaker, the free Roku app does offer a voice-assistant feature. It’s best when completing a general search for a show or actor or for launching a particular app. If you have a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa enabled device, this Roku TV will support them, and they offer a generally better experience than using the Roku app voice remote function.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123729/7443" target="_top" id="2123729">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123729" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123729/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great bargain on a budget"></a><strong>Price: A great bargain on a budget</strong></h2><p> If you don’t want to spend a fortune on a 4K TV, but you want to get as much value as possible, the TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a compelling option. It retails for $350, which situates it in the growing and competitive class of 4K TVs under $500. In the TCL 4-Series alone you have several other models to consider that all share the same specifications except for size. The larger 55-inch TCL Roku TV retails for just $30 more than the 50-inch version and features a larger screen size of 54.6 inches. It may not seem considerable, but if you’re limited with space, the extra width and height (five and two inches, respectively) can actually feel like a pretty massive difference. And if you opt for a smaller display and a lower price tag, the 43-inch TCL Roku TV retails for about $280, but you’re sacrificing 7 inches of display.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition"><a href="#TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition" class="headerlink" title="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"></a><strong>TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</strong></h2><p> The TCL 50-inch Roku TV is not without external competitors either. The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition retails for about $100 more and runs on the Fire OS, which stands toe-to-toe with the Roku platform with access to over 500,000 shows and movies. The Toshiba Fire TV comes with an Alexa-enabled remote, an edge for shoppers who want the ease of a voice assistant built right into the remote. But the Roku TV supports both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as voice control through the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> While the Toshiba TV is in the 55-inch class, the screen size is actually the same as the Roku TV. The former, however is visibly taller, wider, and bulkier. The Toshiba Fire TV does havea slight advantage when it comes to audio quality. The sound can get quite loud and full-bodied, thanks to two 10-watt speakers and DTS Studio Sound&#x2F;DTS TruSurround. On the other hand, the picture quality may not be as impressive as the Roku TV, which really doesn’t require a lot of tweaking to enjoy. And if you’re a fan of the simple Roku interface, you may find the Fire OS dashboard to be a bit cluttered.</p><p> Browse our other recommendations on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >best smart TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and best TVs under $500.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/toshiba-55lf711u20-55-inch-fire-tv-edition-review-4772221" >Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A budget-friendly 4K TV that offers impressive picture and overall value.</strong></p><p> The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a smart 4K TV that possesses many merits: an appealing price point, excellent 4K HDR picture quality, a size profile that won’t overwhelm small rooms or apartments, and an easy-to-use interface that requires little fuss.

Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

YourTube"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://yourtubetheme.com/youtube-channel-art-templates/" >YourTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>With over 500 templates available, YourTube has the largest selection on this list. They have every style you can think of, from minimalist to video game themed.</p><p>The site is run by two web designers who make the money they need to maintain the site from the few premium&#x2F;paid options available (although the vast majority of templates are free).</p><p>Most of the templates are JPG backgrounds which you will need to add your own text to.</p><h2 id="Part-2-9-Banner-Makers-with-Free-Templates"><a href="#Part-2-9-Banner-Makers-with-Free-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates"></a>Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates</h2><p>In this section you’ll find 9 YouTube channel art makers.</p><h4 id="1-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#1-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="1.

Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="2-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#2-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Spark"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker" >Adobe Spark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>To edit the templates available through Adobe Spark, just click on the resources in the template and then click on the images&#x2F;fonts&#x2F;etc you want to substitute in. Resources like filters are also very accessible.</p><p>Everything you do in Spark starts with clicking on an element in the template. You won’t see all of the menus at once, just the ones related to the element you’ve selected (i.e. the background image or the text).</p><p>The only downside of Spark is that free downloads include a watermark. The silver lining is that that watermark is small and located in the bottom-right corner, meaning that it won’t show up for viewers watching your channel on either computers or mobile devices.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> for some reason when you click ‘Create your YouTube channel art’ it will load a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Click Resize in the side menu to switch to channel art or your exported image won’t be big enough.</em></p><h4 id="3-BeFunky"><a href="#3-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="3. BeFunky"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.befunky.com/" >BeFunky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a graphics creator that doubles as a banner maker. You’ll need to enter BeFunky’s ‘Designer’ tool in order to find the channel art templates under ‘Social Media Headers’ and ‘YouTube’. There’s actually only 1 free channel art template, but it is a very standard channel art layout which you can customize with your own images.</p><h4 id="4-Canva"><a href="#4-Canva" class="headerlink" title="4. Canva"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Canva is one of the most popular free channel art makers. It is an easy to use, drag and drop, program that will automatically resize images to work in the spaces you drag them to. It has great free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but many are free.</p><p>The templates on Canva do tend to include paid resources, but it’s easy enough to swap them out with free resources or your own images.</p><h4 id="5-Crello"><a href="#5-Crello" class="headerlink" title="5. Crello"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/" >Crello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Crello offers 10 examples free channel art templates through their blog, and you can even edit the templates right on the site.</p><p>Crello is an easy to use visual editor created for social media and marketing, meaning that it was made to be easy for non-designers to jump into. Beyond the free templates and text options, however, most of their stock photos and backgrounds cost $1. To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.</p><h4 id="6-Design-Wizard"><a href="#6-Design-Wizard" class="headerlink" title="6. Design Wizard"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.designwizard.com/" >Design Wizard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.</p><p>Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.</p><h4 id="7-Fotor"><a href="#7-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="7. Fotor"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another graphics program with free templates for YouTube channel art. Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.</p><p>There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.</p><h4 id="8-Snappa"><a href="#8-Snappa" class="headerlink" title="8. Snappa"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art" >Snappa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.</p><p>Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.</p><h4 id="9-Visme"><a href="#9-Visme" class="headerlink" title="9. Visme"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/" >Visme <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Visme provides 50 free channel art templates you can edit through their online graphics service. The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.</p><p>How did you make your banner?

To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.</p><h4 id="6-Design-Wizard-3"><a href="#6-Design-Wizard-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Design Wizard"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.designwizard.com/" >Design Wizard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.</p><p>Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.</p><h4 id="7-Fotor-3"><a href="#7-Fotor-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.</p><p>There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.</p><h4 id="8-Snappa-3"><a href="#8-Snappa-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Snappa"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art" >Snappa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.</p><p>Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.</p><h4 id="9-Visme-3"><a href="#9-Visme-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Visme"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/" >Visme <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Visme provides 50 free channel art templates you can edit through their online graphics service. The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.</p><p>How did you make your banner?

According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.</p><p><strong>Why vlogs are loved by people</strong></p><p>Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.</p><p>But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley.

Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today.

Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience-1"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience-1" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving-1"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving-1" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren’t making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.</p><h3 id="What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience-1"><a href="#What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience-1" class="headerlink" title="What solutions am I offering?

Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?</h3><p>The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you’re addressing the target audience’s needs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel</h2><p>It’s easy to get started on YouTube.

(what is a niche, and how to find)</h3><p>A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you’re passionate about and what you’re good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you’re offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.</p><h3 id="Consistency-and-patience-1"><a href="#Consistency-and-patience-1" class="headerlink" title="Consistency and patience"></a>Consistency and patience</h3><p>Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality-1"><a href="#Content-quality-1" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads-1"><a href="#YouTube-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship-1"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship-1" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing-1"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it’s through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.</p><h3 id="Patreon-1"><a href="#Patreon-1" class="headerlink" title="Patreon"></a>Patreon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg"                      alt="support on patreon"                ></p><p>Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.</p><h3 id="Sell-your-service-or-products-1"><a href="#Sell-your-service-or-products-1" class="headerlink" title="Sell your service or products"></a>Sell your service or products</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg"                      alt="sell products or services"                ></p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users, there’s an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services.

Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category. As for services, you could also offer tips on improving your life, starting an online business, or even becoming a successful Youtuber!</p><h2 id="Part-4-Top-10-Highest-Paid-Vloggers-on-YouTube-1"><a href="#Part-4-Top-10-Highest-Paid-Vloggers-on-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube"></a>Part 4: Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</h2><p>Vloggers on YouTube are earning some big money.

This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134494/18498" target="_top" id="2134494">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134494" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134494/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Green"><a href="#Why-Green" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139557/4704" target="_top" id="2139557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139557/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully.

Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues.

Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly.

One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste.

Light adjustments to edge thickness and screen matte settings can also help enhance overall visual quality and add finesse to your work.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Green screen photography produces excellent results, and its ease of use makes it indispensable for videographers of all levels. In this guide, we’ve discussed chroma key technology, its role in the industry, and how to apply it to your craft to elevate visual content.</p><p>Chroma key, also known as green screen or blue screen, is a cool hack for seamless visual storytelling, allowing content creators to replace backgrounds with any image or video they want. This technique is widely embraced in film, television, and online content, and has opened the door to limitless creative possibilities. Aside from its ability to maximize creativity, it is also cheap to employ and convenient to set up, which has made it a staple for everyone who works with visuals.</p><p>In this simple guide, we’ll delve into the fundamentals of the <strong>chroma key effect</strong>, how it is used for video making, and how to leverage that as you perfect your visual content.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="How-Does-Chroma-Key-Work-1"><a href="#How-Does-Chroma-Key-Work-1" class="headerlink" title="How Does Chroma Key Work?"></a><strong>How Does Chroma Key Work?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/a-quick-guide-to-chroma-key-background-2.jpg"                      alt="green screen shooting"                ></p><p>Chroma Keying is done by singling out a specific color (usually green or blue) from the foreground, removing it, and replacing it with a different background (for example, a sunset). This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><h2 id="Why-Green-1"><a href="#Why-Green-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio-1"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production.

The scientific explanations of ASMR and the list of its potential causes of this reaction are not as extensive as they can be.</p><p>Moreover, the visual and audio content that is designed to trigger the ASMR is perceived as unusual which further contributes to the controversy associated with this genre of videos. You are at the right place if you would like to learn more about ASMR because in this article we are going to take you through all the things you need to know about ASMR.</p><h2 id="How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work"><a href="#How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do ASMR Videos Work?"></a>How Do ASMR Videos Work?</h2><p>As strange as it may sound, millions of people around the globe are watching videos of someone whispering into a microphone, and apparently, it is helping them deal with stress, anxiety, and insomnia.</p><p>However, watching a video in any setting isn’t enough to trigger ASMR. You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing. Whether or not ASMR videos can achieve this goal is debatable.</p><h2 id="Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone"><a href="#Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone" class="headerlink" title="Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?"></a>Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?</h2><p>The short and simple answer is no. In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep. Whether or not the ASMR video will achieve the desired effect largely depends on the person watching it, because the AMSR trigger the video features may not affect the viewer who is sensitive to different types of stimuli.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers"><a href="#The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers" class="headerlink" title="The Most Common ASMR Triggers"></a>The Most Common ASMR Triggers</h2><p>It is still unclear what can trigger an ASMR since scientific research in this field has been scarce. Hence, it is difficult to know exactly what and under which circumstances can initiate such a reaction.</p><p>However, this phenomenon can be triggered by the following stimuli:</p><h3 id="1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice"><a href="#1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice"></a>1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice</h3><p>This is by far the most common ASMR trigger. Speaking in a low soft voice will likely create a tingling and pleasant sensation that will ultimately relax the listener. Consequently, the vast majority of ASMR video hosts are whispering or speaking softly into the microphone.</p><h3 id="2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks"><a href="#2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks" class="headerlink" title="2.

In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep. Whether or not the ASMR video will achieve the desired effect largely depends on the person watching it, because the AMSR trigger the video features may not affect the viewer who is sensitive to different types of stimuli.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers-3"><a href="#The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers-3" class="headerlink" title="The Most Common ASMR Triggers"></a>The Most Common ASMR Triggers</h2><p>It is still unclear what can trigger an ASMR since scientific research in this field has been scarce. Hence, it is difficult to know exactly what and under which circumstances can initiate such a reaction.</p><p>However, this phenomenon can be triggered by the following stimuli:</p><h3 id="1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice-3"><a href="#1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice"></a>1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice</h3><p>This is by far the most common ASMR trigger. Speaking in a low soft voice will likely create a tingling and pleasant sensation that will ultimately relax the listener. Consequently, the vast majority of ASMR video hosts are whispering or speaking softly into the microphone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137394/7443" target="_top" id="2137394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks-3"><a href="#2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks</h3><p>The sounds created while turning the pages of a book, crumpling a piece of paper, or typing on a mechanical keyboard can all be potential ASMR triggers. It seems that the pleasant sensation is associated with the repetitiveness of these sounds, as they create a calming atmosphere.</p><h3 id="3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task-3"><a href="#3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors</h3><p>Some people have the ability to trigger ASMR consciously without having to resort to audio or visual stimuli. However, this is quite rare as most members of the ASMR community rely on video and audio content to trigger the ASMR.</p><h3 id="7-Tapping-on-a-surface-3"><a href="#7-Tapping-on-a-surface-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Tapping on a surface"></a>7. Tapping on a surface</h3><p>Tapping on the surface of a microphone or the surface of plastic or metal objects is yet another common ASMR trigger.

A hand touching a face"></a>8. A hand touching a face</h3><p>Tactile stimuli like a hand touching a face are known to be ASMR triggers.

Hearing a particular genre of music"></a>9. Hearing a particular genre of music</h3><p>People who love music often have a physical reaction to it.

Listening to someone exhale into a mic"></a>10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic</h3><p>This ASMR trigger is frequently used in ASMR videos. Like all other audio ASMR triggers, blowing air into a microphone can help a person relax and fall asleep.</p><h2 id="What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular-3"><a href="#What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular-3" class="headerlink" title="What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?"></a>What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?</h2><p>A little over a year ago there were more than 13 million ASMR videos on YouTube, which shows vividly how popular this genre of video has become. Moreover, the videos containing hosts and animals eating different types of food have amassed billions of views.</p><p>The stressful lives we all lead, boredom, or simply the need to experience something different are the most common reasons why people watch ASMR videos. In addition, the viewers of these videos suggest that they help them deal with depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems. Over the course of the last decade, the ASMR videos have risen from obscurity to become one of the most popular genres of YouTube videos largely due to their uniqueness and their relaxing nature.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos-3"><a href="#Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find ASMR videos?"></a>Where to Find ASMR videos?</h2><p>A simple google search will reveal a variety of ASMR videos, since all major video hosting platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, or Vimeo offer a broad selection of ASMR videos. Their contents vary from simple videos of hosts whispering into a microphone to carefully planned and staged role plays. Also, you try installing the app called Tingles on your Smartphone if you want to have access to a huge collection of ASMR triggers.</p><p>Moreover, ASMR videos can be found on websites that host pornographic content, which is the consequence of the sexualization of this phenomenon. Therefore where to look for ASMR videos depends on the type of ASMR content you’re looking for. One thing is certain, you won’t have much trouble finding ASMR videos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the decade, ASMR was a little known phenomenon very few people knew about. Today, ASMR videos attract huge audiences from all around the world, as they’ve become one of the most popular types of videos on YouTube and other video hosting platforms.</p><p>Despite the enormous popularity of ASMR content, we still have much to learn about the phenomenon itself and what triggers it. The little information that is available indicates that not everyone is capable of having an autonomous sensory meridian response to audio or visual stimuli. Furthermore, the potential triggers vary from whispering to watching someone prepare food, which contributes to the mystery surrounding the phenomenon.</p><p>Hopefully, this article has helped you develop a better understanding of ASMR.

When you’re stuck, the best thing to do can be to keep your ideas simple. Focus on being engaging instead of on coming up with an original idea nobody’s ever tried – your video will be original because you’re the one doing it and you’re unique.</p><p>They say that less is more, so let’s have a look at how you can apply this principle to practice and create amazing YouTube videos from small ideas.</p><ol><li><a href="#one">Introduce Yourself</a></li><li><a href="#two">Vlog About Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#three">Express an Opinion</a></li><li><a href="#four">Review Anything</a></li><li><a href="#five">Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc.</a></li><li><a href="#six">What’s on Your Phone?</a></li><li><a href="#seven">Make a Slideshow</a></li><li><a href="#eight">Make a Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#nine">10 Things About You</a></li><li><a href="#ten">Video Rant</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-Introduce-Yourself"><a href="#1-Introduce-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduce Yourself"></a>1. Introduce Yourself</h2><p>Let the world know who you are and what you do. If you are planning on starting a YouTube channel, or if you’ve already been posting videos on a topic but haven’t formally introduced yourself, it’s a great idea to put some thought into an introduction video. Producing such a YouTube video will enable you to introduce yourself to your future subscribers and give them an idea as to what your channel is all about.</p><p>These kinds of videos make great channel trailers, and they’re a good way to highlight the topics you’ll be covering on your channel in the future.</p><h2 id="2-Vlog-About-Your-Day"><a href="#2-Vlog-About-Your-Day" class="headerlink" title="2. Vlog About Your Day"></a>2. Vlog About Your Day</h2><p>Anything that happens during your day can become a topic for your YouTube vlog. Traffic jams, treacherous pets who keep stealing your shoes, or the ridiculous amount of things you had to do in a single day can all become topics for videos you upload to your YouTube channel. Being candid and spontaneous is a sure way to grab the attention of a viewer, but limiting the duration of a vlog to a few minutes is key to ensuring that viewers watch the video until the end.</p><p>Strive to make visually dynamic videos, because just sitting or standing and talking in front of a camera for a few minutes isn’t going to create much on-screen action.</p><h2 id="3-Express-An-Opinion"><a href="#3-Express-An-Opinion" class="headerlink" title="3. Express An Opinion"></a>3. Express An Opinion</h2><p>Social media culture has enabled us to receive news instantly and react to it in any way we want. If you didn’t like the latest update of your favorite video game, or if you’re excited about a line of makeup that’s coming out soon, make a video about it and share your opinion with the community that follows you on YouTube.</p><p>Opinion videos are great conversation starters. Expressing an opinion through a YouTube video can get you a lot of comments and even inspire others to take action.</p><p>You can express your opinions on virtually any topic, but being respectful while doing so is for the best if you don’t want to find yourself in a YouTube feud.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137974" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137974/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Review-Anything"><a href="#4-Review-Anything" class="headerlink" title="4. Review Anything"></a>4. Review Anything</h2><p>Everywhere around you, there are items you can review. The Apple Watch and the latest season of Game of Thrones are equally good choices for a review video. However, when creating review videos you need to make sure that all the factual information you have is accurate, which is why it is much better to make review videos about topics you know a lot about.</p><p>Review videos can also be a source of revenue because a lot of companies sponsor YouTubers who review their products.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc"><a href="#5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc" class="headerlink" title="5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc"></a>5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc</h2><p>Are you a Tarantino fan? Why not? When you are struggling to find inspiration for your videos, just think about the things you like. Your subscribers are interested in you, so they’ll be interested in knowing about your favorite movies or music albums. Books, movies, and music are an inexhaustible source of fresh ideas because there is always a new song or a film you can talk about in your video.</p><p>You can do a ‘my 5 favorite songs’ type of video, or talk in detail about just one favorite.</p><h2 id="6-What’s-on-Your-Phone"><a href="#6-What’s-on-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="6. What’s on Your Phone?"></a>6. What’s on Your Phone?</h2><p>There were over two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2017, and this number is only going to continue rising in the next couple of years. Furthermore, thousands of YouTubers are already producing unimaginable amounts of videos about the latest apps or smartphone devices.</p><p>Finding a way to talk about the apps you like to use the most can be a good idea if you want to attract more visitors to your YouTube channel. However, you need to be clear about whether this is a lifestyle or vlog-style video covering a topic that usually exists in the tech genre, or if you are a tech YouTuber, so as not to confuse your audience (you don’t want people to start expecting app reviews if that’s not what you usually do).</p><h2 id="7-Make-a-Slideshow"><a href="#7-Make-a-Slideshow" class="headerlink" title="7. Make a Slideshow"></a>7. Make a Slideshow</h2><p>There’s no need to constantly produce new videos because you can just take some royalty-free music and create a slideshow from your old or new photos. The slideshow format will certainly allow you to try something different on your YouTube channel, while the photos you use in the slideshow can create a clear picture of who you are and what you do for your viewers.</p><p>If you are a photography enthusiast you can also plan the entire slideshow in advance and then make a short video about how you created the images in the slideshow.</p><h2 id="8-Make-a-Tutorial"><a href="#8-Make-a-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="8. Make a Tutorial"></a>8. Make a Tutorial</h2><p>Education is our only hope for a better world so if you know how to do something well, don’t be afraid to share your knowledge. A tutorial is a powerful educational tool that enables you to guide people through the entire process of making origami, solving a complicated video editing problem, maintaining a motorcycle, or anything else.</p><p>YouTube channels that feature tutorials often have millions of followers, because YouTube is a popular place to go when you need information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-10-Things-About-You"><a href="#9-10-Things-About-You" class="headerlink" title="9. 10 Things About You"></a>9. 10 Things About You</h2><p>Being open is important, so why not share 10 things about yourself you think your audience would find interesting or which you think are important for people to know. The top 10 things structure is often used in YouTube videos because it provides a clear rhythm to a video clip, and it enables you to gradually increase the tension as the video progresses.</p><p>These types of videos tend to create a better relationship with your audience because they make the viewer feel as if they know the person on the screen.</p><h2 id="10-Video-Rant"><a href="#10-Video-Rant" class="headerlink" title="10. Video Rant"></a>10. Video Rant</h2><p>Doing things when you are angry is usually a bad idea, but if you feel so strongly about a particular subject then creating a video rant can be a great idea. Rants don’t even have to be angry, they can be about something that puzzles you or something so great you just can’t get over it. These kinds of videos can get your YouTube channel a lot of comments, likes, and subscribers.</p><p>Don’t try to fake a rant, because they only work if they are natural.
