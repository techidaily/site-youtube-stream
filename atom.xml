If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown.

It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p><p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p><ol><li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li><li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li></ol><p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p><p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right.

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg"                      alt="how-to-use-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p><p><strong>7.

It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p><p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p><ol><li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li><li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li></ol><p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p><p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right.

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg"                      alt="how-to-use-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p><p><strong>7.

It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p><p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p><ol><li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li><li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li></ol><p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p><p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right.

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg"                      alt="how-to-use-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p><p><strong>7.

The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p><p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p><p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p><h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p><p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p><p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p><h2 id="2-Shotcut-–-Open-Source-Windows-Mac-Linux"><a href="#2-Shotcut-–-Open-Source-Windows-Mac-Linux" class="headerlink" title="2.

There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p><p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p><p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p><h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p><p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p><h2 id="3-Hitfilm-Express-–-Windows-Mac"><a href="#3-Hitfilm-Express-–-Windows-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3.

OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p><p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p><p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p><p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p><h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes.

It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p><p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p><p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p><p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p><h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p><p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p><h2 id="5-Lightworks-–-Windows-Mac-Linux"><a href="#5-Lightworks-–-Windows-Mac-Linux" class="headerlink" title="5.

This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p><p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p><p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p><h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p><p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p><p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p><p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p><h2 id="6-VSDC-Video-Editor-–-Windows"><a href="#6-VSDC-Video-Editor-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="6.

Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="7.

It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><h2 id="8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD"><a href="#8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD" class="headerlink" title="8.

I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-5"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-5" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Dec 02, 2022• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>What makes a YouTube video good?

This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites.

Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p><p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p><h2 id="6-VSDC-Video-Editor-–-Windows-1"><a href="#6-VSDC-Video-Editor-–-Windows-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-1"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><h2 id="8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-1"><a href="#8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-1" class="headerlink" title="8.

I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-6"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-6" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Dec 02, 2022• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>What makes a YouTube video good?

This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p><p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use).

Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-2"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><h2 id="8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-2"><a href="#8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-7"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-7" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Dec 02, 2022• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>What makes a YouTube video good?

It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p><h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p><p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there).

You will need those because this program can be overwhelming.

It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p><p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p><p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p><p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p><h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p><p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p><h2 id="5-Lightworks-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-3"><a href="#5-Lightworks-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p><p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p><p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’.

Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-3"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><h2 id="8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-3"><a href="#8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-step-formula-how-to-check-youtube-income/"><u>In 2024, [3-Step Formula] How To Check YouTube Income</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-maximizing-youtube-clicks-with-imagery/"><u>In 2024, Maximizing YouTube Clicks with Imagery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-from-novice-to-pro-mastering-the-art-of-youtube-shorts/"><u>[New] From Novice to Pro  Mastering the Art of YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-your-strategy-top-rated-techniques-for-video-marketing/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Your Strategy  Top-Rated Techniques for Video Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mobile-youtube-watching-iphone-and-android-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  Mobile YouTube Watching  IPhone & Android Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ryan-kajis-net-worth-11-year-old-boy-gets-highest-paid-from-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Ryan Kaji’s Net Worth  11-Year-Old Boy Gets Highest-Paid From YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-passive-viewers-to-earnings-youtubes-monetization-mastery/"><u>2024 Approved  From Passive Viewers to Earnings  YouTube's Monetization Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/navigating-green-screen-integration-in-post-production-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Green Screen Integration in Post-Production for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-imovie-essentials-making-your-youtube-openers-stand-out/"><u>[New] IMovie Essentials  Making Your YouTube Openers Stand Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-global-viewer-count-triumphs-play-button-honors/"><u>2024 Approved  Global Viewer Count Triumphs  Play Button Honors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-laugh-loops-crafting-comical-content-for-brevity-based-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Laugh Loops  Crafting Comical Content for Brevity-Based Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-gain-an-edge-access-these-top-8-sites-for-free-eco-screen-backdrops-and-clips/"><u>2024 Approved  Gain an Edge - Access These Top 8 Sites for FREE Eco-Screen Backdrops and Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-monitor-top-youtube-videos-select-rank-trackers-guide/"><u>In 2024, Monitor Top YouTube Videos - Select Rank Trackers Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-strategic-broadcast-planning-youtube-and-the-top-30-networks/"><u>[New] Strategic Broadcast Planning  YouTube & The Top 30 Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/incredible-illusions-youtubes-magic-masterpieces-edited-for-2024/"><u>Incredible Illusions  YouTube's Magic Masterpieces Edited for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-youtubes-monetization-frequency/"><u>In 2024, Navigating YouTube's Monetization Frequency</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-flutter-freedom-for-videos-the-best-tools-to-flv-to-youtubes/"><u>[New] Flutter Freedom for Videos  The Best Tools to Flv-to-YouTubes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-understanding-fair-use-and-infringement-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, Understanding Fair Use and Infringement on YouTube</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Here we recommend using Filmora to easily edit YouTube videos.</p><p>You can use Filmora to make YouTube videos with built-in royalty-free audio. Filmora also can help you make YouTube intros. It includes more than 500 templates, transitions, effects, and text resources.</p><h2 id="1-Not-Everyone-Who-Clicks-Adds-to-Your-View-Count"><a href="#1-Not-Everyone-Who-Clicks-Adds-to-Your-View-Count" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count"></a>1. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count</h2><p>YouTube doesn’t provide a clear definition of what counts as a view, but we know that someone clicks on your video, and clicking right away doesn’t count. That’s how we know that watch time is a factor. Some studies conclude that a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/library/social-video-metrics/#9" >full 30 seconds need to be viewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to register as one view, but there is no way to know for sure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-count-view.JPG"                      alt="how YouTube counts view"                ></p><h2 id="2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views"><a href="#2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does YouTube Count Views?"></a>2. How Does YouTube Count Views?</h2><p>YouTube wants to be sure that views are coming from humans and not bots. So, during the first couple of hours after you publish a video, YouTube seems to be stricter about what they count. The views which are counted are the ones that YouTube believes to be legitimate. Sometimes, it ends up skipping legitimate views for the sake of discretion.</p><p>Once this window of time passes, it is likely that you will see the view counter start to update a lot more frequently. The counter could still revert to updating slower and more hesitantly, though, if YouTube’s algorithm thinks it’s detecting something fishy.</p><p>At times, your view count can even be frozen temporarily until the algorithm can validate the views you are receiving. This is done to ensure a fair and positive experience for everyone who creates content. View counts can be adjusted by the algorithm in either direction.</p><p>You May Also Like:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > 5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Optimization [Free Checklist] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work"><a href="#3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work" class="headerlink" title="3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?"></a>3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?</h2><p>Termed by many as one of the most boggling algorithms of all time, it is really hard to decode the complete dynamics of the YouTube view count algorithm.</p><p>There are some tests you can run yourself to try to unpack it.</p><p>If you upload a video and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >set it as unlisted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t get any public views so you can experiment by doing things like watching for different lengths of time and seeing what gets counted.</p><p>You’ll have to use a computer in a different location and make sure the account is not the same as the one you used to upload the video. Now, you need to watch the video for roughly 15 seconds. The key here is to keep it less than 30 seconds. You will see that the view did not add to the count. If you repeat this process on multiple computers at varying locations and with different accounts and you are likely to find the same result.</p><p>However, if you watch it for 30 seconds or longer it is likely that the count will go up.</p><p>We are adding ‘likely’ here because, despite this 30-second rule which has been decoded, there are other factors that might contribute to whether a view is counted as well as other automated scanning techniques at play.</p><p>Try to watch the same video numerous times in a single day. You will find that the count will add up at first, but after some time it will stop. YouTube knows that a lot of times people replay some videos over and over when they really enjoy them, and so they want to factor replays into their algorithm because they suggest quality. However, to avoid spam views, the counter will stop after a certain point.</p><h2 id="4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count"><a href="#4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count" class="headerlink" title="4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count"></a>4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count</h2><p>Something else that can affect whether a view is counted is the behavior of the account which watches it prior to landing on your video’s watch page. Sometimes, YouTube might feel that there is an increased chance a particular account is actually a bot, and then views from that account might not be added.</p><p>One way that <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27792330?hl=en" >YouTube might flag an account as a potential bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is if it is jumping between videos directly without navigating through recommendations, the search engine, or the account’s subscriber feed (how are they getting between these watch page URLs if they aren’t clicking on anything YouTube can record?). To add to it, if the viewer is watching each of the videos for almost 30 seconds exactly (or less) there is an increased probability that it is not a human but a bot (or a human watching the bare minimum as part of a view exchange program).</p><p>Any bot-like action will result in an account’s views do not be added to your view count.</p><h2 id="5-The-Skip-Skim"><a href="#5-The-Skip-Skim" class="headerlink" title="5. The Skip &amp; Skim"></a>5. The Skip &amp; Skim</h2><p>It’s not uncommon for viewers to watch a video for say five seconds, skip forwards a bit and watch for another ten seconds as they look for a specific part. It is hard to say whether skipping through a video, but watching a scattered 30 seconds, would count as a view or not.</p><h2 id="6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts"><a href="#6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts" class="headerlink" title="6. Frozen YouTube View Counts"></a>6. Frozen YouTube View Counts</h2><p>Sometimes YouTube will freeze a view count in order to check that it is accurate. When the count is unfrozen, the count may jump up as views are validated or it can go down if YouTube detects a problem.</p><p>You can use <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/" >YouTube’s analytics reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to monitor an estimate of your potential views, but there is no assurance that this data will completely match your official view count.</p><h2 id="7-The-301-Mark"><a href="#7-The-301-Mark" class="headerlink" title="7. The 301 Mark"></a>7. The 301 Mark</h2><p>You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.</p><p>This is why view counts are often frozen at 301. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.</p><p>During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away" >YouTube says <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t flag videos at 301 views anymore.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views.

Some studies conclude that a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/library/social-video-metrics/#9" >full 30 seconds need to be viewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to register as one view, but there is no way to know for sure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-count-view.JPG"                      alt="how YouTube counts view"                ></p><h2 id="2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views-3"><a href="#2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does YouTube Count Views?"></a>2. How Does YouTube Count Views?</h2><p>YouTube wants to be sure that views are coming from humans and not bots. So, during the first couple of hours after you publish a video, YouTube seems to be stricter about what they count. The views which are counted are the ones that YouTube believes to be legitimate. Sometimes, it ends up skipping legitimate views for the sake of discretion.</p><p>Once this window of time passes, it is likely that you will see the view counter start to update a lot more frequently. The counter could still revert to updating slower and more hesitantly, though, if YouTube’s algorithm thinks it’s detecting something fishy.</p><p>At times, your view count can even be frozen temporarily until the algorithm can validate the views you are receiving. This is done to ensure a fair and positive experience for everyone who creates content. View counts can be adjusted by the algorithm in either direction.</p><p>You May Also Like:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > 5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Optimization [Free Checklist] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work-3"><a href="#3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?"></a>3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?</h2><p>Termed by many as one of the most boggling algorithms of all time, it is really hard to decode the complete dynamics of the YouTube view count algorithm.</p><p>There are some tests you can run yourself to try to unpack it.</p><p>If you upload a video and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >set it as unlisted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t get any public views so you can experiment by doing things like watching for different lengths of time and seeing what gets counted.</p><p>You’ll have to use a computer in a different location and make sure the account is not the same as the one you used to upload the video. Now, you need to watch the video for roughly 15 seconds. The key here is to keep it less than 30 seconds. You will see that the view did not add to the count. If you repeat this process on multiple computers at varying locations and with different accounts and you are likely to find the same result.</p><p>However, if you watch it for 30 seconds or longer it is likely that the count will go up.</p><p>We are adding ‘likely’ here because, despite this 30-second rule which has been decoded, there are other factors that might contribute to whether a view is counted as well as other automated scanning techniques at play.</p><p>Try to watch the same video numerous times in a single day. You will find that the count will add up at first, but after some time it will stop. YouTube knows that a lot of times people replay some videos over and over when they really enjoy them, and so they want to factor replays into their algorithm because they suggest quality. However, to avoid spam views, the counter will stop after a certain point.</p><h2 id="4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count-3"><a href="#4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count"></a>4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count</h2><p>Something else that can affect whether a view is counted is the behavior of the account which watches it prior to landing on your video’s watch page. Sometimes, YouTube might feel that there is an increased chance a particular account is actually a bot, and then views from that account might not be added.</p><p>One way that <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27792330?hl=en" >YouTube might flag an account as a potential bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is if it is jumping between videos directly without navigating through recommendations, the search engine, or the account’s subscriber feed (how are they getting between these watch page URLs if they aren’t clicking on anything YouTube can record?). To add to it, if the viewer is watching each of the videos for almost 30 seconds exactly (or less) there is an increased probability that it is not a human but a bot (or a human watching the bare minimum as part of a view exchange program).</p><p>Any bot-like action will result in an account’s views do not be added to your view count.</p><h2 id="5-The-Skip-Skim-3"><a href="#5-The-Skip-Skim-3" class="headerlink" title="5. The Skip &amp; Skim"></a>5. The Skip &amp; Skim</h2><p>It’s not uncommon for viewers to watch a video for say five seconds, skip forwards a bit and watch for another ten seconds as they look for a specific part. It is hard to say whether skipping through a video, but watching a scattered 30 seconds, would count as a view or not.</p><h2 id="6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts-3"><a href="#6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Frozen YouTube View Counts"></a>6. Frozen YouTube View Counts</h2><p>Sometimes YouTube will freeze a view count in order to check that it is accurate. When the count is unfrozen, the count may jump up as views are validated or it can go down if YouTube detects a problem.</p><p>You can use <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/" >YouTube’s analytics reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to monitor an estimate of your potential views, but there is no assurance that this data will completely match your official view count.</p><h2 id="7-The-301-Mark-3"><a href="#7-The-301-Mark-3" class="headerlink" title="7. The 301 Mark"></a>7. The 301 Mark</h2><p>You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.</p><p>This is why view counts are often frozen at 301. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.</p><p>During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away" >YouTube says <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t flag videos at 301 views anymore.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots. Ultimately, ‘how does YouTube count views’ isn’t a question anyone but YouTube can answer for sure, but we do know it isn’t as simple as ‘a view is someone clicking on your video’.</p><p>If you want to engage your audience with cool effects and Filmora is the best choice to make a split-screen and green screen video for YouTubers.

Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-7"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-7" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>You use YouTube to watch videos, post your own content, and build up a following. That is how YouTube works for you. This article is about how YouTube works technically. There are a lot of steps which occur between you clicking ‘upload’ and a viewer clicking ‘play’. Understanding this process can be useful to YouTubers because it can help shed light on where problems may be occurring when you have issues uploading or watching videos. Generally when there is a problem it is on your end and there are multiple simple things you can do to fix it.</p><p>This article will explain what goes on behind the scenes when you upload a video, where that video really goes, and what happens when somebody clicks play.</p><h2 id="How-Does-YouTube-Work-3"><a href="#How-Does-YouTube-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does YouTube Work"></a>How Does YouTube Work</h2><h4 id="1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload-3"><a href="#1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload-3" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens When You Upload?"></a>1. What Happens When You Upload?</h4><p>When you upload a video your computer or device packages it into IP packets. Packets are fragments of information containing both data from your video and the address you are sending it to, in this case YouTube. The packets are encoded into radio signals which are sent through a wifi or cellular network. Your video travels through switches and routers on the internet until they reach YouTube’s servers. Your video is then reassembled and stored.</p><p>If uploading takes a long time for you it probably has nothing to do with YouTube; there is a lot that needs to happen for your video to even get there. How long the upload process takes depends on a number of factors including how many devices share your internet connection, how strong your wifi signal is, and the age of your router. If your uploads are taking too long consider compressing your videos before you upload them. You can also try uploading from your college campus or public libraries as institutions like these tend to have fast internet speeds.</p><h4 id="2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored-3"><a href="#2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Where is Your Video Stored?"></a>2. Where is Your Video Stored?</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-works.JPG"                      alt="how youtube works"                ></p><p>As it is owned by Google YouTube uses Google’s ‘Bigtable’, a compressed data storage system which allows it to store the 500+ hours of video uploaded to its servers every minute. Bigtable is software, though, not hardware. YouTube and Google both have massive amounts of data and it needs to be physically housed somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videos-uploaded-to-youtube.jpg"                      alt="videos uploaded to youtube"                ></p><p>Google has Modular Data Centers all over the world where it keeps its servers. These centers could cost as much as $600 million dollars each and consume huge amounts of electricity. There are six of them in the United States, three in Europe, two in Asia, and one is South America.</p><h4 id="3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video-3"><a href="#3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?"></a>3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.</p><p>Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won’t know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.</p><p>Make sure your video description is 250 words or more.

You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views"><a href="#Number-of-Views" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views.

For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.</p><h4 id="Using-Video-Hashtags"><a href="#Using-Video-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Using Video Hashtags"></a>Using Video Hashtags</h4><p>Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging.

It’s all about flexing your creativity muscle and we are here to help you do it. Are you ready to be inspired? Great! Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9. Be a Fan and a Critic</strong></h2><p><strong>Fanfiction:</strong> Continue a story of one of your favorite movie characters or explore the life of some secondary character in a television show that you enjoy. Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment" class="headerlink" title="10. Create Entertainment"></a><strong>10. Create Entertainment</strong></h2><p><strong>Fails:</strong> Don’t get embarrassed, get views. Embrace your shortcomings and accept that everybody has failed at something. Be careful and don’t get hurt too bad though.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Channel your <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barelypolitical" >Key of Awesome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your own parody of something from pop culture. If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop. Share your screen as you write a poem.</p><p><strong>Cinematography:</strong> There is always a place for beautiful cinematography on YouTube. Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary. Remember that when making a documentary, think about it as making a movie – you are not there to lecture them. Can you get people<a class="link"   href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/michael-moores-13-rules-for-making-documentary-films-22384/" >riled up as Michael Moore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does? Can you encourage people to take action? If yes, then you are ready to start making documentary-style YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Lip-sync:</strong> Can’t sing but feel you have a musical gift to give to the world, well, they will never put you on the billboards for what you can do lip-syncing, but you can make a pretty entertaining YouTube video through this medium. It doesn’t even have to be music either, take <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gneBUA39mnI" >Bad Lip Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Impressions:</strong> A good impression is always worth a good laugh, and a bad one is almost as good. Give it a shot, pull up videos of some of your favorite celebrities, and film yourself attempting to mimic their voice, characteristics and expressions.</p><p><strong>Sketch Comedy, Short Film, or Role Play:</strong> Do you have characters and scenes in mind that will be perfect for SNL? Well, instead of having to go through Lorne Michaels, create the character yourself and publish your comedy sketch on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Interview:</strong> Find a subject matter experts and ask them interesting questions about their profession and areas of interest.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> Play a game with your friends or other YouTubers and allow the competitiveness, frustration, and hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Okay! How do you feel?</p><p>I bet you are bursting and ready to create your next video. Onwards! Remember, whatever idea you pick, be sure to give it your own flair. That is what YouTube is all about.

It’s all about flexing your creativity muscle and we are here to help you do it. Are you ready to be inspired? Great! Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-1"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself-1"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent-1"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-1"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator-1"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-1"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-1"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-1"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9. Be a Fan and a Critic</strong></h2><p><strong>Fanfiction:</strong> Continue a story of one of your favorite movie characters or explore the life of some secondary character in a television show that you enjoy. Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment-1"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Create Entertainment"></a><strong>10. Create Entertainment</strong></h2><p><strong>Fails:</strong> Don’t get embarrassed, get views. Embrace your shortcomings and accept that everybody has failed at something. Be careful and don’t get hurt too bad though.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Channel your <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barelypolitical" >Key of Awesome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your own parody of something from pop culture. If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop. Share your screen as you write a poem.</p><p><strong>Cinematography:</strong> There is always a place for beautiful cinematography on YouTube. Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary. Remember that when making a documentary, think about it as making a movie – you are not there to lecture them. Can you get people<a class="link"   href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/michael-moores-13-rules-for-making-documentary-films-22384/" >riled up as Michael Moore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does? Can you encourage people to take action? If yes, then you are ready to start making documentary-style YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Lip-sync:</strong> Can’t sing but feel you have a musical gift to give to the world, well, they will never put you on the billboards for what you can do lip-syncing, but you can make a pretty entertaining YouTube video through this medium. It doesn’t even have to be music either, take <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gneBUA39mnI" >Bad Lip Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Impressions:</strong> A good impression is always worth a good laugh, and a bad one is almost as good. Give it a shot, pull up videos of some of your favorite celebrities, and film yourself attempting to mimic their voice, characteristics and expressions.</p><p><strong>Sketch Comedy, Short Film, or Role Play:</strong> Do you have characters and scenes in mind that will be perfect for SNL? Well, instead of having to go through Lorne Michaels, create the character yourself and publish your comedy sketch on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Interview:</strong> Find a subject matter experts and ask them interesting questions about their profession and areas of interest.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> Play a game with your friends or other YouTubers and allow the competitiveness, frustration, and hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Okay! How do you feel?</p><p>I bet you are bursting and ready to create your next video. Onwards! Remember, whatever idea you pick, be sure to give it your own flair. That is what YouTube is all about.

Content Idea Resources</strong></h2><p>Before we go deeper into the search to find you the best topics for YouTube, let’s take a quick look at some tools that may help you warm up and get your creative juices flowing.</p><p><a href="https://www.portent.com/tools/title-maker"><strong>Portent’s Content Title Idea Generator</strong></a>: Put in one of your keywords in this content idea generator and it will come up with an interesting title for you.</p><p><a href="http://www.wetheunicorns.com/quizzes/video-idea-generator/"><strong>We The Unicorn’s Video Idea Generator Quiz</strong></a>: Answer this multiple-choice quiz and allow the algorithm to suggest a YouTube video idea that best suits your style.</p><p><a href="https://www.filmora.io/701-youtube-video-ideas"><strong>701 YouTube Video Ideas [eBook]</strong></a>: You’ll save time brainstorming, be able to post consistently, and grow your YouTube channel faster with this book of ideas.</p><p>As you can see, coming up with ideas doesn’t have to be an agonizing drag. It’s all about flexing your creativity muscle and we are here to help you do it. Are you ready to be inspired? Great! Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-2"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself-2"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent-2"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-2"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator-2"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-2"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-2"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-2"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9. Be a Fan and a Critic</strong></h2><p><strong>Fanfiction:</strong> Continue a story of one of your favorite movie characters or explore the life of some secondary character in a television show that you enjoy. Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment-2"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment-2" class="headerlink" title="10. Create Entertainment"></a><strong>10. Create Entertainment</strong></h2><p><strong>Fails:</strong> Don’t get embarrassed, get views. Embrace your shortcomings and accept that everybody has failed at something. Be careful and don’t get hurt too bad though.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Channel your <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barelypolitical" >Key of Awesome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your own parody of something from pop culture. If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop. Share your screen as you write a poem.</p><p><strong>Cinematography:</strong> There is always a place for beautiful cinematography on YouTube. Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary. Remember that when making a documentary, think about it as making a movie – you are not there to lecture them. Can you get people<a class="link"   href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/michael-moores-13-rules-for-making-documentary-films-22384/" >riled up as Michael Moore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does? Can you encourage people to take action? If yes, then you are ready to start making documentary-style YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Lip-sync:</strong> Can’t sing but feel you have a musical gift to give to the world, well, they will never put you on the billboards for what you can do lip-syncing, but you can make a pretty entertaining YouTube video through this medium. It doesn’t even have to be music either, take <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gneBUA39mnI" >Bad Lip Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Impressions:</strong> A good impression is always worth a good laugh, and a bad one is almost as good. Give it a shot, pull up videos of some of your favorite celebrities, and film yourself attempting to mimic their voice, characteristics and expressions.</p><p><strong>Sketch Comedy, Short Film, or Role Play:</strong> Do you have characters and scenes in mind that will be perfect for SNL? Well, instead of having to go through Lorne Michaels, create the character yourself and publish your comedy sketch on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Interview:</strong> Find a subject matter experts and ask them interesting questions about their profession and areas of interest.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> Play a game with your friends or other YouTubers and allow the competitiveness, frustration, and hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Okay! How do you feel?</p><p>I bet you are bursting and ready to create your next video. Onwards! Remember, whatever idea you pick, be sure to give it your own flair. That is what YouTube is all about.

You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself-3"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent-3"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-3"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator-3"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-3"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-3"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-3"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9. Be a Fan and a Critic</strong></h2><p><strong>Fanfiction:</strong> Continue a story of one of your favorite movie characters or explore the life of some secondary character in a television show that you enjoy. Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment-3"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Create Entertainment"></a><strong>10. Create Entertainment</strong></h2><p><strong>Fails:</strong> Don’t get embarrassed, get views. Embrace your shortcomings and accept that everybody has failed at something. Be careful and don’t get hurt too bad though.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Channel your <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barelypolitical" >Key of Awesome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your own parody of something from pop culture. If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop. Share your screen as you write a poem.</p><p><strong>Cinematography:</strong> There is always a place for beautiful cinematography on YouTube. Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary. Remember that when making a documentary, think about it as making a movie – you are not there to lecture them. Can you get people<a class="link"   href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/michael-moores-13-rules-for-making-documentary-films-22384/" >riled up as Michael Moore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does? Can you encourage people to take action? If yes, then you are ready to start making documentary-style YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Lip-sync:</strong> Can’t sing but feel you have a musical gift to give to the world, well, they will never put you on the billboards for what you can do lip-syncing, but you can make a pretty entertaining YouTube video through this medium. It doesn’t even have to be music either, take <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gneBUA39mnI" >Bad Lip Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Impressions:</strong> A good impression is always worth a good laugh, and a bad one is almost as good. Give it a shot, pull up videos of some of your favorite celebrities, and film yourself attempting to mimic their voice, characteristics and expressions.</p><p><strong>Sketch Comedy, Short Film, or Role Play:</strong> Do you have characters and scenes in mind that will be perfect for SNL? Well, instead of having to go through Lorne Michaels, create the character yourself and publish your comedy sketch on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Interview:</strong> Find a subject matter experts and ask them interesting questions about their profession and areas of interest.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> Play a game with your friends or other YouTubers and allow the competitiveness, frustration, and hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Okay! How do you feel?</p><p>I bet you are bursting and ready to create your next video. Onwards! Remember, whatever idea you pick, be sure to give it your own flair. That is what YouTube is all about. Got another YouTube video idea you want to share?

Below are some tips to keep in mind if you want to learn how to write a script for your YouTube video.</p><ol><li><a href="#before">Before Write Your YouTube Script</a></li><li><a href="#writing">Writing a Script for a YouTube Video</a></li><li><a href="#after">After Writing Your YouTube Video Script</a></li><li><a href="#bonus">Bonus Tip- Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</a></li></ol><h2 id="Before-You-Write-Your-YouTube-Script-3"><a href="#Before-You-Write-Your-YouTube-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="Before You Write Your YouTube Script"></a>Before You Write Your YouTube Script</h2><p>Here are some things to do before you start writing your script for YouTube:</p><h3 id="1-Collect-Ideas-3"><a href="#1-Collect-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Collect Ideas"></a>1. Collect Ideas</h3><p>Before you write the script, it’s a good idea to gather ideas. If you think of something, or if something funny happens, write it down right away. Keep a pen and notebook handy that way you will not forget about it.</p><h3 id="2-Find-an-area-that-is-not-distracting-3"><a href="#2-Find-an-area-that-is-not-distracting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Find an area that is not distracting"></a>2. Find an area that is not distracting</h3><p>Once you have gathered enough ideas for the YouTube video, the next step is to find a place where you can write in peace and be inspired. Avoid any distractions to ensure that you will be able to put all your thoughts and ideas onto paper.</p><h2 id="Writing-a-Script-for-a-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#Writing-a-Script-for-a-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Writing a Script for a YouTube Video"></a>Writing a Script for a YouTube Video</h2><p>Now that you’re ready to sit down and write, here’s what you do:</p><h3 id="1-Create-an-outline-for-your-story-3"><a href="#1-Create-an-outline-for-your-story-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Create an outline for your story"></a>1. Create an outline for your story</h3><p>The first step in writing a script is to develop an outline for the story. You might think that it is an unnecessary step, but it’s one of the most important steps to writing a script. The outline serves as a guide that will make the finished product better compared to when you just tried to wing it. One tip on how to write a script for a YouTube video is to have an outline for the beginning, middle, and ending of the video. Once you have all the elements of the story, then you can start with the first draft of the script.</p><h3 id="2-Set-the-tone-3"><a href="#2-Set-the-tone-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Set the tone"></a>2. Set the tone</h3><p>The tone you pick for the video will depend on your audience. It’s safe to assume that viewers want something that’s unique, informative, and engaging. In some cases, they look for a video that’s personal, and they can relate to it. Humor is also something that you should consider when writing a script.</p><h3 id="3-Just-keep-writing-3"><a href="#3-Just-keep-writing-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Just keep writing"></a>3. Just keep writing</h3><p>When you start writing it is important that you keep on doing it no matter what happens. Just write down everything that comes into your mind. After that, read what you’ve written. If you think that something needs to be replaced, then replace it. If you get more inspiration and think that the script is lacking, then add to it.</p><h3 id="4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured-3"><a href="#4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Make sure that the script is well structured"></a>4. Make sure that the script is well structured</h3><p>It’s important to learn how to write a script that is well structured. Divide the script into four parts: Opening, Primer, Body, and Closing.</p><p>For the Opening part, ask a simple question that can be answered in the Body. Use the Primer section to inform viewers what they should expect from the video. The Body will contain the main content of the video. It should cover all the things that viewers need to know. Lastly, the closing wraps up the video by providing social media details and a teaser for the next video.</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep It Concise</strong></li></ul><p>In a personal vlog-style video you might ramble and go off on amusing tangents, and that’s something viewers love within that genre. If you are trying to teach, however, your viewers will benefit more if you keep things concise and direct.</p><p>Tell people up front what point you are trying to make before you jump into making it.</p><ul><li><strong>Be Interactive</strong></li></ul><p>Talk to people, not at them.</p><p>While you are scripting and focusing on the information you want to deliver, it’s easy to forget to be personal.</p><p>Remember to refer to your audience as ‘you’, not ‘you guys’ (you are speaking to individual viewers, not a collective) and to include moments of engagement throughout your videos. Ask your viewers questions to keep their minds active, this also encourages them to leave comments.</p><h2 id="After-Writing-your-YouTube-Video-Script-3"><a href="#After-Writing-your-YouTube-Video-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="After Writing your YouTube Video Script"></a>After Writing your YouTube Video Script</h2><p>After writing the script, the next step is to invite a trusted friend or family member to look at the script. Ask them for their feedback and if they have any ideas to add. And don’t forget, be open-minded to feedback</p><p>These are the tips to keep in mind when considering how to write a script for a YouTube video.</p><h2 id="Add-Subtitles-to-Your-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Add-Subtitles-to-Your-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Creating subtitles with Wondershare Filmora is very easy and a newbie can easily add relevant texts to the video they are trying to edit with Filmora.

Let’s start by taking a look at the best YouTube keyword tools available.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-autocomplete"><a href="#1-YouTube-autocomplete" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube autocomplete"></a>1. YouTube autocomplete</h4><p>When you start to search for something on YouTube, you’ll probably notice that YouTube suggests some keywords to finish your search. This is called autocomplete, and it works by suggesting the most popular keywords that start with the letters you’ve typed so far. What it is essentially saying is that those are the most frequently searched for terms that use the words you’ve already typed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-complete.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>This means it’s a great place to start building your keywords, and a fantastic YouTube keyword tool for your videos. Just start your search for your video (e.g. shoes for…) and see what comes up. In this case, we can see that the most popular keywords are ‘girls’, ‘men’, ‘kids’, ‘summer’ and ‘boys’.</p><h4 id="2-Keywordtool-io"><a href="#2-Keywordtool-io" class="headerlink" title="2.

Let’s start by taking a look at the best YouTube keyword tools available.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-autocomplete-2"><a href="#1-YouTube-autocomplete-2" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube autocomplete"></a>1. YouTube autocomplete</h4><p>When you start to search for something on YouTube, you’ll probably notice that YouTube suggests some keywords to finish your search. This is called autocomplete, and it works by suggesting the most popular keywords that start with the letters you’ve typed so far. What it is essentially saying is that those are the most frequently searched for terms that use the words you’ve already typed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-complete.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>This means it’s a great place to start building your keywords, and a fantastic YouTube keyword tool for your videos. Just start your search for your video (e.g. shoes for…) and see what comes up. In this case, we can see that the most popular keywords are ‘girls’, ‘men’, ‘kids’, ‘summer’ and ‘boys’.</p><h4 id="2-Keywordtool-io-2"><a href="#2-Keywordtool-io-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Keywordtool.io"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keywordtool.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Without doubt, this is one of the most powerful YouTube keyword tools out there, ranking hundreds of keywords by popularity. It captures data from YouTube autocomplete and allows you to create lists of keywords from that data. As well as autocompete data, you can also search for questions people are asking, which makes it highly beneficial as a YouTube SEO tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>The downside to this particular tool is that it’s fairly limited on the free version. Upgrading to Pro Basic will give you almost double the keyword results and will let you compare the volume of searches made for those terms too. However, this will set you back around $68 a year, so it’s going to be something of an investment if you go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io-result.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool "                ></p><h4 id="3-SEOChat-2"><a href="#3-SEOChat-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can search for keywords from all of those sources or can just search YouTube alone to find your keyword lists. You’ll need a ‘seed’ keyword, such as ‘shoes’, ‘make up’ or ‘marketing’, and then organizes results alphabetically with other letters following your seed keyword.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seochat-youtube.jpg"                      alt="SEOChat youtube keyword tool SEOChat"                ></p><p>Simply scrolling through the results is going to give you loads of ideas for keywords and possibly content too. The tool also allows you to further expand your results by selecting a keyword and running ‘part two’ of the process, which expands those phrases even further. Your chosen keywords can be exported from the software, ready for use in your YouTube SEO tool.</p><h4 id="4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor-2"><a href="#4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Gather keywords from your competitor"></a>4. Gather keywords from your competitor</h4><p>Why not learn from the best and see what’s already working for your competitors? Finding their high traffic keywords is easy and can save a lot of time and energy. To do this, pick a channel that is around your size, as they’re your nearest competitors. Steer clear of the huge channels, as you’ll find it hard to rank next to them.</p><p>Click the videos tab to see their content, and sort them by ‘most popular’ to see the ones which got the most views. Take a look at the <strong>title</strong> and the <strong>description</strong> of those videos, and you’ll find a good fistful of proven keywords that you can start using yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/most-popular-video-youtube-channel.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>That’s not all though. To maximize your competitor research, let’s dig a little deeper into the <strong>tags</strong> they have used for their videos too. Unfortunately, these are hidden on YouTube, but are easily seen using the page’s HTML. Simply right click on the page and select ‘view source’. Don’t be alarmed at the great stream of HTML that pops up, it’s easy to search using your search function (press ctrl + f on Windows or ⌘ + f on iOS) by typing in ‘keywords’ to the search box. The following terms are the tags used in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-keywords-youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>If ploughing through HTML sounds somewhat taxing, there is a handy YouTube SEO tool you can use to display the tags on page. It’s called <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy-for-youtube/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb" >TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and is a Chrome extension which you’ll find in the Chrome store for free.</p><h4 id="5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator-2"><a href="#5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Keyword Tool Dominator"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.keywordtooldominator.com/k/youtube-keyword-tool" >Keyword Tool Dominator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>It’s got a grand name, but it’s actually really easy to use and a great place to start if you’re new to YouTube keyword research. Pop in your seed keywords and the Dominator will produce a list of relevant keywords related to those terms. You can then select the most useful and download them to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Keyword-tool-dominator.jpg"                      alt="tool for youtube keyword"                ></p><p>The drawback with this is that you can only perform three searches a day on the free version. Perhaps that’s enough for you to begin with, but if you want to upgrade to the unlimited version, which will also give you search volumes, it’s a one-off fee of $39.99.</p><h4 id="6-Ubersuggest-2"><a href="#6-Ubersuggest-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

Let’s start by taking a look at the best YouTube keyword tools available.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-autocomplete-3"><a href="#1-YouTube-autocomplete-3" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube autocomplete"></a>1. YouTube autocomplete</h4><p>When you start to search for something on YouTube, you’ll probably notice that YouTube suggests some keywords to finish your search. This is called autocomplete, and it works by suggesting the most popular keywords that start with the letters you’ve typed so far. What it is essentially saying is that those are the most frequently searched for terms that use the words you’ve already typed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-complete.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>This means it’s a great place to start building your keywords, and a fantastic YouTube keyword tool for your videos. Just start your search for your video (e.g. shoes for…) and see what comes up. In this case, we can see that the most popular keywords are ‘girls’, ‘men’, ‘kids’, ‘summer’ and ‘boys’.</p><h4 id="2-Keywordtool-io-3"><a href="#2-Keywordtool-io-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Keywordtool.io"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keywordtool.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Without doubt, this is one of the most powerful YouTube keyword tools out there, ranking hundreds of keywords by popularity. It captures data from YouTube autocomplete and allows you to create lists of keywords from that data. As well as autocompete data, you can also search for questions people are asking, which makes it highly beneficial as a YouTube SEO tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>The downside to this particular tool is that it’s fairly limited on the free version. Upgrading to Pro Basic will give you almost double the keyword results and will let you compare the volume of searches made for those terms too. However, this will set you back around $68 a year, so it’s going to be something of an investment if you go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io-result.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool "                ></p><h4 id="3-SEOChat-3"><a href="#3-SEOChat-3" class="headerlink" title="3. SEOChat"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://seochat.io/tools/keyword-suggest-tool" >SEOChat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>SEO Chat is an amazing free tool that can generate keyword ideas from Google, Amazon, Bing and YouTube. You can search for keywords from all of those sources or can just search YouTube alone to find your keyword lists. You’ll need a ‘seed’ keyword, such as ‘shoes’, ‘make up’ or ‘marketing’, and then organizes results alphabetically with other letters following your seed keyword.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seochat-youtube.jpg"                      alt="SEOChat youtube keyword tool SEOChat"                ></p><p>Simply scrolling through the results is going to give you loads of ideas for keywords and possibly content too. The tool also allows you to further expand your results by selecting a keyword and running ‘part two’ of the process, which expands those phrases even further. Your chosen keywords can be exported from the software, ready for use in your YouTube SEO tool.</p><h4 id="4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor-3"><a href="#4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Gather keywords from your competitor"></a>4. Gather keywords from your competitor</h4><p>Why not learn from the best and see what’s already working for your competitors? Finding their high traffic keywords is easy and can save a lot of time and energy. To do this, pick a channel that is around your size, as they’re your nearest competitors. Steer clear of the huge channels, as you’ll find it hard to rank next to them.</p><p>Click the videos tab to see their content, and sort them by ‘most popular’ to see the ones which got the most views. Take a look at the <strong>title</strong> and the <strong>description</strong> of those videos, and you’ll find a good fistful of proven keywords that you can start using yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/most-popular-video-youtube-channel.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>That’s not all though. To maximize your competitor research, let’s dig a little deeper into the <strong>tags</strong> they have used for their videos too. Unfortunately, these are hidden on YouTube, but are easily seen using the page’s HTML. Simply right click on the page and select ‘view source’. Don’t be alarmed at the great stream of HTML that pops up, it’s easy to search using your search function (press ctrl + f on Windows or ⌘ + f on iOS) by typing in ‘keywords’ to the search box. The following terms are the tags used in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-keywords-youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>If ploughing through HTML sounds somewhat taxing, there is a handy YouTube SEO tool you can use to display the tags on page. It’s called <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy-for-youtube/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb" >TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and is a Chrome extension which you’ll find in the Chrome store for free.</p><h4 id="5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator-3"><a href="#5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Keyword Tool Dominator"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.keywordtooldominator.com/k/youtube-keyword-tool" >Keyword Tool Dominator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>It’s got a grand name, but it’s actually really easy to use and a great place to start if you’re new to YouTube keyword research. Pop in your seed keywords and the Dominator will produce a list of relevant keywords related to those terms. You can then select the most useful and download them to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Keyword-tool-dominator.jpg"                      alt="tool for youtube keyword"                ></p><p>The drawback with this is that you can only perform three searches a day on the free version. Perhaps that’s enough for you to begin with, but if you want to upgrade to the unlimited version, which will also give you search volumes, it’s a one-off fee of $39.99.</p><h4 id="6-Ubersuggest-3"><a href="#6-Ubersuggest-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Ubersuggest"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For getting more data on specific keywords, Ubersuggest from the SEO guru that is Neil Patel is one of the best tools out there. As well as showing search volume and competition, you can see other information such as cost per click and the seasonality of the keyword. It’s free to use with no limitations at all, so is well worth checking out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ubersuggest-youtube-keywords.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="7-Google-trends-3"><a href="#7-Google-trends-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Google trends"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >Google trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>We would highly recommend investigating Google Trends as part of your YouTube keyword research, as it is powerful, accurate and, best of all, free! The options let you narrow down the trend results to just YouTube searches, which is great for gaining insights to your search terms. You can narrow down the results to a specific country too, helping you to gain insight into what your target demographic is currently interested in.</p><h4 id="8-VidIQ-3"><a href="#8-VidIQ-3" class="headerlink" title="8. VidIQ"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The keyword tool in VidIQ is one of very few research tools that has a function for just YouTube built in. You can paste in the keywords you want to research, choose the country you wish to target, and it will return all the search volumes and amount of competition, and will score your keywords based on these figures.</p><p>On the downside, there is a fairly complicated subscription process to go through if you want to upgrade from the free version. To be honest, the free version is OK for new users, but for in depth analytics you’re going to want to upgrade eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-vidiq.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool VidIQ"                ></p><h4 id="9-Keyword-Keg-3"><a href="#9-Keyword-Keg-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

It offers lots of data, drawn from a variety of data sources including Wikipedia, Alibaba, Playstore and more. There are filters for country and language and you can drill down into issues like buyer intent and product info. However, as with most free YouTube keyword tools, there is a strict limit on what you can do before you pay. In this case, you only get to see the first five results unless you want to upgrade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-keywordkeg.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="10-Kparser-3"><a href="#10-Kparser-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

You can use it to find YouTube keywords free to use. More than finding the best core keywords, this tool can also give you suggestions on long tail keywords in every field. By use this, you don’t need to worry that you can’t the right keywords to use in title, description and tags. You also can selcet country and language when searching a YouTube keyword. For searching more than one keyword, remember to seperate them with coma.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/kparser.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool Kparser"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Bonus-Tips-Google-Video-Result-Keywords-3"><a href="#Part-2-Bonus-Tips-Google-Video-Result-Keywords-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bonus Tips - Google Video Result Keywords"></a>Part 2: Bonus Tips - Google Video Result Keywords</h3><p>Getting your video ranking highly on YouTube is excellent and will certainly bring you more traffic.

Google decides what should and shouldn’t trigger a video result, and usually shows them when a video would make sense, for example when someone asks ‘how to’ or searches for ‘cute’ or ‘funny’ things.</p><p>There’s a bit of trial and error involved as there is no YouTube keyword tool to find video result keywords… yet. But you can use Google to search your keywords and see if they are video result keywords. Just type them in, and if a video appears in the listings below, you’ve discovered a video result keyword that is well worth optimizing for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Mastering-YouTube’s-SEO-Landscape-A-Keyword-Expedition"><a href="#Mastering-YouTube’s-SEO-Landscape-A-Keyword-Expedition" class="headerlink" title="Mastering YouTube’s SEO Landscape: A Keyword Expedition"></a>Mastering YouTube’s SEO Landscape: A Keyword Expedition</h2><h5 id="Improve-Your-YouTube-Video-Performance-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Improve-Your-YouTube-Video-Performance-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Improve Your YouTube Video Performance with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Improve Your YouTube Video Performance with Wondershare Filmora</h5><p>An easy and powerful video editor for YouTube Video</p><p>Numerous video and audio effects to choose from</p><p>Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>With more than 1 billion hours of video watched every day, YouTube is the world’s second-largest search engine.

Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels.

Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk.

With so much competition on the platform, it’s crucial that you stand out from the crowd with efficient, professional videos that are a pleasure to watch.</p><p> Without some planning and structure in mind before you begin filming, it’s all too easy to get a bit lost and start to ramble or fumble your words. Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p><p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p><ul><li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li><li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li><li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li></ul><p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p><h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p><p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p><h3 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p><ol><li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li></ol><p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p><ol><li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li></ol><p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p><p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p><h3 id="Hook"><a href="#Hook" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p><p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p><h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be.

Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p><ul><li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li><li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li><li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li></ul><p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p><h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content-1"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content-1" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p><h3 id="Intro-1"><a href="#Intro-1" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p><p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end.

How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p><p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step.

There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p><h3 id="Hook-1"><a href="#Hook-1" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p><p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p><h3 id="Outro-1"><a href="#Outro-1" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals.

If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic.

If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring.

The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken.

Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel.

Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p><p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though. This article will walk you through signing up for a YouTube account, and give you some tips about starting your channel.</p><h2 id="Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps-2"><a href="#Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps-2" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps"></a>Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account new gmail"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account after new gmail"                ></p><p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p><p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p><p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p><p>6. After you finish the form click Next Step and, in the next screen, Continue to YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel-2"><a href="#Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel-2" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel"></a>Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel</h2><h4 id="1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love-2"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition-2"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name-2"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-2"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p><h4 id="5-Take-Inventory-2"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

You had to accumulate over 1,000 subscribers and over 4,000 public watch hours. This can be difficult to attain, especially on a platform where creators are publishing new content every day. However, the 2023 update on the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) provided an easier way to start making money on YouTube.

The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>The monetization features of both these platforms are entirely different.

Thus, even though it keeps up the promise of creating, watching, and sharing both long and short-form content, it may turn away those who prefer focused access to quick content. Regardless, with YouTube Shorts now starting to become available to more users, the battle in the viral video market with TikTok is sure to heat up.</p><p>Before giving you our opinion on which is the better platform for short video promotion, go through the following conversation first.</p><p>Ramona Pringle is an associate professor and a tech expert at Toronto’s Ryerson University. She said in an interview that because YouTube already has figured out video content, the transformation to add short-form video will be natural.</p><p>She also mentioned that YouTube Shorts is the platform best placed with the competition from TikTok than all other platforms. However, YouTube doesn’t need to be TikTok as it has its strategies and broad audience base.</p><p>Like Pringle, Matt Navarra, a social media consultant based in the U.K., said in an interview that Shorts is a logical evolution and extension of YouTube, which has further given rise to TikTok. But unlike TikTok, Shorts has a few features that it can take benefit from. Among these features is the extensive audio library content, the greater scope for users to remix and create duets and stuff from scratch. Undoubtedly, you can’t deny the experience of YouTube in terms of access to partnerships with the music industry and licensing.</p><p>Thus, keeping all these factors in mind, we’d like to conclude that both the YouTube Shorts and TikTok are great and considerable platforms for short video promotion. Still, we’d like to place YouTube Shorts in the upper place due to its global availability. Whereas TikTok is already banned in certain countries.</p><p>It also depends upon the audience base of the country as to which platform is in use the most. Suppose it’s TikTok that people primarily use in a particular country or location where the brand wants to advertise itself. In that case, going with TikTok for short video promotion is better and vice versa.</p><p>To get more information, click the following video!</p><h3 id="TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice"><a href="#TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice" class="headerlink" title="TikTok or YouTube?

On the other hand, TikTok’s ‘private’ video option only allows the creator to view the video.</li><li>You can view the TikTok analytics directly in the TikTok app. On the other hand, YouTube Shorts analytics can be visible in YouTube Studio.</li></ul><h3 id="Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…-3"><a href="#Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…-3" class="headerlink" title="Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…"></a>Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…</h3><ul><li>A stitch and duet feature, where users can add other creators’ videos to their accounts.</li><li>A Q&amp;A feature to leave questions for creators to answer with a video.

Thus, even though it keeps up the promise of creating, watching, and sharing both long and short-form content, it may turn away those who prefer focused access to quick content. Regardless, with YouTube Shorts now starting to become available to more users, the battle in the viral video market with TikTok is sure to heat up.</p><p>Before giving you our opinion on which is the better platform for short video promotion, go through the following conversation first.</p><p>Ramona Pringle is an associate professor and a tech expert at Toronto’s Ryerson University. She said in an interview that because YouTube already has figured out video content, the transformation to add short-form video will be natural.</p><p>She also mentioned that YouTube Shorts is the platform best placed with the competition from TikTok than all other platforms. However, YouTube doesn’t need to be TikTok as it has its strategies and broad audience base.</p><p>Like Pringle, Matt Navarra, a social media consultant based in the U.K., said in an interview that Shorts is a logical evolution and extension of YouTube, which has further given rise to TikTok. But unlike TikTok, Shorts has a few features that it can take benefit from. Among these features is the extensive audio library content, the greater scope for users to remix and create duets and stuff from scratch. Undoubtedly, you can’t deny the experience of YouTube in terms of access to partnerships with the music industry and licensing.</p><p>Thus, keeping all these factors in mind, we’d like to conclude that both the YouTube Shorts and TikTok are great and considerable platforms for short video promotion. Still, we’d like to place YouTube Shorts in the upper place due to its global availability. Whereas TikTok is already banned in certain countries.</p><p>It also depends upon the audience base of the country as to which platform is in use the most. Suppose it’s TikTok that people primarily use in a particular country or location where the brand wants to advertise itself. In that case, going with TikTok for short video promotion is better and vice versa.</p><p>To get more information, click the following video!</p><h3 id="TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice-3"><a href="#TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice-3" class="headerlink" title="TikTok or YouTube?

Once more, the title and the description you provided will play a crucial role in driving more traffic to your videos, so make sure that each video you post on YouTube has an effective title that will spark interest in a potential viewer to take action and actually watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/suggested-videos-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Suggested videos that appear next to the video</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/suggested-videos-2.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Suggested videos that appear after the video</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/suggested-videos-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Suggested videos that appear from links in a video description.</p><h4 id="YouTube-Advertising"><a href="#YouTube-Advertising" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Advertising"></a>YouTube Advertising</h4><p> Investing in the promotion of the content you’re posting on your channel can help you to generate more views, but different types of YouTube ads produce different results. Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p><h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system. In either case, your videos are discovered through search results or video suggestions.</p><p><strong>Browse Features -</strong> The homepage of your YouTube channel as well as the subscription feed and all other browse features can be a potential source of views for your videos. The YouTube users who watch a video on your channel can be either signed-in or signed-out, but the YouTube Analytics tool will still recognize their action as a view.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/browse-features.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>Playlists -</strong> Producing content other YouTubers will want to include in their playlists is one of the best ways to attract more traffic and increase the amount of views videos you upload to your YouTube channel are getting.</p><h4 id="External-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#External-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="External Traffic Sources"></a>External Traffic Sources</h4><p> Even though YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, sharing a link to a video on social media such as Twitter or Facebook or embedding it on your website can significantly increase the number of views the video is getting.</p><p> Sources of traffic mentioned above are not equally effective, because the intent to actually watch the video varies greatly for each source. That’s why you’ll be able to achieve the best results if you combine several, if not all sources of traffic described in this guide.</p><h3 id="How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics"><a href="#How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics" class="headerlink" title="How to Come Up With SEO Topics"></a>How to Come Up With SEO Topics</h3><p> Videos are a form of communication, and like with all forms of communication, you must know who you are addressing in order to know what to say. Defining the target audience before you start creating a video will make the SEO optimization process much simpler and much faster.</p><p> Let’s say that you want to become a successful beauty vlogger and your aim is to produce makeup tutorials. Your first step should be to determine which market is the most relevant for you. Assuming you’d like to target the Asian market, it becomes obvious that the audience you’ll be addressing will consist of women in need of practical makeup advice and your colleagues who offer similar types of tutorials.</p><p> Now that you’ve defined your target audience you can proceed to develop the content strategy. People search videos for many different reasons, but their motivation can be approximately divided into four micro-moments. These are:</p><p><strong>I want to know, I want to go, I want to do and I want to buy</strong> moments and some or all can be applied to all types of YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>I want to know moments</strong> refer to YouTube users who want to learn more about a certain topic and often ask how to perform a certain action. In the beauty niche, the search terms may include questions like ‘Is makeup bad for your skin?’ or ‘What is contouring?’.</p><p><strong>I want to do</strong> moments reflect a certain need the potential viewer of your videos has, and your video should provide a straightforward answer. Most common <strong>I want to do</strong> search patterns for beauty vloggers are ‘How to apply mascara, eyeliner, etc..’</p><p> If you know quite a bit about beauty products, then producing videos that rely on <strong>I want to buy</strong> moments is a sure way to attract a lot of traffic to your videos. These include product reviews, top ten videos or comparison videos that offer the reasons for and against buying a certain product.</p><p> Furthermore, you should try to think of a way to create a makeup video that makes the viewer feel involved, so even if you are just explaining the basic terms or tools in the video, viewers should have the feeling that they are learning something.</p><p> After defining your target audience and determining what you have to offer, you can choose the topic based on keywords.

These channels probably have a significant number of videos so just sort them out using the ‘Most Popular’ option.</p><p> Click on a video that has the most views and that also has a topic that isn’t far removed from what you want to do. When the video is open, look for the keyword around which it is centered, in the title, description or tags and just find a creative way to incorporate it into your video.</p><p><strong>Use YouTube’s Traffic Sources and Search Report:</strong></p><p> If you would like to find out which keywords YouTubers have used to find your videos this is your best option. Even though the chances are you’ll know most keywords in the report since you already used them for SEO optimization of your videos, you might come up with a few unexpected entries that might be useful.</p><p> Look for low-competition keywords, because frequently used keywords are already used by videos featured on channels that have a lot of followers. Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p><p> YouTube keyword tools:</p><p> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="The-Metadata-Process"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value.

Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p><h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-1"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-1" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system.

Let’s have a look at five traffic sources that will boost the number of views and comments videos are getting.</p><h4 id="YouTube-Search-2"><a href="#YouTube-Search-2" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Search"></a>YouTube Search</h4><p> A great deal of traffic for your videos can come from the search results, which makes the title of a video one of the most important aspects of SEO optimization on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-search-traffic.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Don’t use long titles, strive to use short and catchy titles that also contain keywords which accurately describe the contents of the video in order to appear higher in the YouTube’s search results.</p><h4 id="Suggested-Videos-2"><a href="#Suggested-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Videos"></a>Suggested Videos</h4><p> The platform offers video suggestions that cover topics similar to those of the videos you already watched. Once more, the title and the description you provided will play a crucial role in driving more traffic to your videos, so make sure that each video you post on YouTube has an effective title that will spark interest in a potential viewer to take action and actually watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/suggested-videos-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Suggested videos that appear next to the video</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/suggested-videos-2.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Suggested videos that appear after the video</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/suggested-videos-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Suggested videos that appear from links in a video description.</p><h4 id="YouTube-Advertising-2"><a href="#YouTube-Advertising-2" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Advertising"></a>YouTube Advertising</h4><p> Investing in the promotion of the content you’re posting on your channel can help you to generate more views, but different types of YouTube ads produce different results. Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p><h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-2"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-2" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system. In either case, your videos are discovered through search results or video suggestions.</p><p><strong>Browse Features -</strong> The homepage of your YouTube channel as well as the subscription feed and all other browse features can be a potential source of views for your videos. The YouTube users who watch a video on your channel can be either signed-in or signed-out, but the YouTube Analytics tool will still recognize their action as a view.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/browse-features.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>Playlists -</strong> Producing content other YouTubers will want to include in their playlists is one of the best ways to attract more traffic and increase the amount of views videos you upload to your YouTube channel are getting.</p><h4 id="External-Traffic-Sources-2"><a href="#External-Traffic-Sources-2" class="headerlink" title="External Traffic Sources"></a>External Traffic Sources</h4><p> Even though YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, sharing a link to a video on social media such as Twitter or Facebook or embedding it on your website can significantly increase the number of views the video is getting.</p><p> Sources of traffic mentioned above are not equally effective, because the intent to actually watch the video varies greatly for each source. That’s why you’ll be able to achieve the best results if you combine several, if not all sources of traffic described in this guide.</p><h3 id="How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-2"><a href="#How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Come Up With SEO Topics"></a>How to Come Up With SEO Topics</h3><p> Videos are a form of communication, and like with all forms of communication, you must know who you are addressing in order to know what to say. Defining the target audience before you start creating a video will make the SEO optimization process much simpler and much faster.</p><p> Let’s say that you want to become a successful beauty vlogger and your aim is to produce makeup tutorials. Your first step should be to determine which market is the most relevant for you. Assuming you’d like to target the Asian market, it becomes obvious that the audience you’ll be addressing will consist of women in need of practical makeup advice and your colleagues who offer similar types of tutorials.</p><p> Now that you’ve defined your target audience you can proceed to develop the content strategy. People search videos for many different reasons, but their motivation can be approximately divided into four micro-moments. These are:</p><p><strong>I want to know, I want to go, I want to do and I want to buy</strong> moments and some or all can be applied to all types of YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>I want to know moments</strong> refer to YouTube users who want to learn more about a certain topic and often ask how to perform a certain action. In the beauty niche, the search terms may include questions like ‘Is makeup bad for your skin?’ or ‘What is contouring?’.</p><p><strong>I want to do</strong> moments reflect a certain need the potential viewer of your videos has, and your video should provide a straightforward answer. Most common <strong>I want to do</strong> search patterns for beauty vloggers are ‘How to apply mascara, eyeliner, etc..’</p><p> If you know quite a bit about beauty products, then producing videos that rely on <strong>I want to buy</strong> moments is a sure way to attract a lot of traffic to your videos. These include product reviews, top ten videos or comparison videos that offer the reasons for and against buying a certain product.</p><p> Furthermore, you should try to think of a way to create a makeup video that makes the viewer feel involved, so even if you are just explaining the basic terms or tools in the video, viewers should have the feeling that they are learning something.</p><p> After defining your target audience and determining what you have to offer, you can choose the topic based on keywords. Here’s how you can easily come up with <strong>keyword ideas</strong> for your YouTube videos.</p><p> How to find the right keywords ideas?</p><p><strong>YouTube Search Suggestions:</strong></p><p> This is by far the easiest and fastest way to come up with an SEO friendly topic for a video. The best part is that the keywords you come up with will work without a doubt since all suggestions are based on search terms actual people have already used.</p><p><strong>Copy the Keywords From a Video in Your Niche that Already Has a Lot of Views:</strong></p><p> Study the competition and find a few channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers that cover the same topics as you. These channels probably have a significant number of videos so just sort them out using the ‘Most Popular’ option.</p><p> Click on a video that has the most views and that also has a topic that isn’t far removed from what you want to do. When the video is open, look for the keyword around which it is centered, in the title, description or tags and just find a creative way to incorporate it into your video.</p><p><strong>Use YouTube’s Traffic Sources and Search Report:</strong></p><p> If you would like to find out which keywords YouTubers have used to find your videos this is your best option. Even though the chances are you’ll know most keywords in the report since you already used them for SEO optimization of your videos, you might come up with a few unexpected entries that might be useful.</p><p> Look for low-competition keywords, because frequently used keywords are already used by videos featured on channels that have a lot of followers. Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p><p> YouTube keyword tools:</p><p> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="The-Metadata-Process-2"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process-2" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value. The following YouTube Ranking factors all play a part in the success your video will enjoy:</p><ul><li>On Video (Metadata)</li><li>Recommendations</li><li>Channel</li><li>User Action</li></ul><p> As you can see, metadata is directly related to the search rankings performance of your videos. So what is metadata exactly?</p><p><strong>Video file name:</strong> The SEO optimization of a YouTube video starts even before you upload the file to your channel. When naming a video file, make sure that the name contains a keyword, because the platform’s algorithm will analyze it and use it to determine how high it should be ranked in the search results.</p><p><strong>Video title:</strong> The title of a YouTube video is added after the upload is complete. So, in order to increase the video’s chances of appearing high in the search results, you should place the keyword at its begging and avoid using titles longer than 70 characters as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The more words you use to describe a video, the better. YouTube descriptions can have up to 5000 characters, which gives you quite a lot of room to use the keywords you’ve selected.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> You can hardly use too many tags, as a matter of fact, you should use as many tags as you can think of. Channel name, brand name, related keywords are all great choices for tags, just keep in mind that they can’t be longer than 127 characters.</p><p> YouTube tag generator:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/tag-generator-for-youtube" >http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/tag-generator-for-youtube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Chances are that the keyword around which your video is based appears quite a lot in the narration and dialogue. YouTube lets you create transcripts of all your videos in just a few simple clicks, which enables you to take the SEO optimization a step further.</p><h3 id="Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-2"><a href="#Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing"></a>Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing</h3><p> One of the greatest advantages YouTube offers is how easy it is to share the links to your videos on social media or anywhere else on the Internet. These off-channel marketing methods can help you drive more traffic to the videos you upload to YouTube:</p><p><strong>Embedding the Link:</strong> Articles covering topics similar to the topic your video is covering are a perfect place to embed a link to the video featured on your channel. What’s more, you can embed a link in your blog posts, on your website, or on a website of a partner company.</p><p><strong>Backlinks:</strong> A backlink is a link from some other website to the particular web resource, in this case, your video. You can insert links that offer additional information about the topic and by doing so increase the traffic.</p><p><strong>Third-party Website Promotion:</strong> Share links to videos you upload to YouTube on websites like Quora or forums such as Filmora.io.</p><p><strong>Team up with Other YouTube Creators:</strong> Looking for cooperation on Fiverr, or just send them private messages to ask for recommendation&#x2F;follow. Add your video in their playlist, or in Related Channel, End-screen card, etc.</p><h3 id="How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-2"><a href="#How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Monitor a Video’s Data?"></a>How to Monitor a Video’s Data?</h3><p> YouTube Analytics is a tool that will enable you to find out more about the people who are watching your videos. How many of your subscribers have watched a video you added to your channel? How many viewers found a video you uploaded through search results? The answer to these questions can be easily found with this tool.</p><p> YouTube Analytics also provides insight into subscriber conversion rates, so you can know exactly which videos attracted the most subscribers. This feature is particularly important if you are still developing your channel since it can help you understand which type of videos inspired a viewer to take action and hit the Subscribe button</p><p> Combining the information supplied by the YouTube Analytics with the data Google Analytics can offer will allow you to get to know the viewers of your videos better, which can be useful when planning the topics of the videos you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel in the future. If you’d like to gain access to more advanced statistics, there are a lot of free and paid YouTube analytics tools that enable you to keep track of the number of video comments, rankings, dislikes, likes, video replies or favorites.</p><p> Each of these metrics serves as a building block of a successful YouTube channel because uploading a video during a weekend or during the working days may not produce the same results. The YouTube analytics tools can assist you in staying one step ahead of your competition and increasing the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel.</p><h4 id="A-Few-Final-Thoughts-2"><a href="#A-Few-Final-Thoughts-2" class="headerlink" title="A Few Final Thoughts"></a>A Few Final Thoughts</h4><p> Just keep these fundamental things into your mind when you’re doing YouTube SEO:</p><p> YouTube will do anything they can to keep viewer watch longer</p><p><strong>So what’s relevant to the content? YouTube</strong></p><p> Always suggest videos from the same creator (so you should use brand, channel name tags)</p><p> Evaluated what people watch next and which video they ignore.</p><p> Displays video with the similar titles and keywords&#x2F;tags</p><p><strong>So what’s relevant to the viewers?

Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p><p> YouTube keyword tools:</p><p> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="The-Metadata-Process-3"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process-3" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value. The following YouTube Ranking factors all play a part in the success your video will enjoy:</p><ul><li>On Video (Metadata)</li><li>Recommendations</li><li>Channel</li><li>User Action</li></ul><p> As you can see, metadata is directly related to the search rankings performance of your videos. So what is metadata exactly?</p><p><strong>Video file name:</strong> The SEO optimization of a YouTube video starts even before you upload the file to your channel. When naming a video file, make sure that the name contains a keyword, because the platform’s algorithm will analyze it and use it to determine how high it should be ranked in the search results.</p><p><strong>Video title:</strong> The title of a YouTube video is added after the upload is complete. So, in order to increase the video’s chances of appearing high in the search results, you should place the keyword at its begging and avoid using titles longer than 70 characters as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The more words you use to describe a video, the better. YouTube descriptions can have up to 5000 characters, which gives you quite a lot of room to use the keywords you’ve selected.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> You can hardly use too many tags, as a matter of fact, you should use as many tags as you can think of. Channel name, brand name, related keywords are all great choices for tags, just keep in mind that they can’t be longer than 127 characters.</p><p> YouTube tag generator:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/tag-generator-for-youtube" >http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/tag-generator-for-youtube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Chances are that the keyword around which your video is based appears quite a lot in the narration and dialogue. YouTube lets you create transcripts of all your videos in just a few simple clicks, which enables you to take the SEO optimization a step further.</p><h3 id="Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing"></a>Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing</h3><p> One of the greatest advantages YouTube offers is how easy it is to share the links to your videos on social media or anywhere else on the Internet. These off-channel marketing methods can help you drive more traffic to the videos you upload to YouTube:</p><p><strong>Embedding the Link:</strong> Articles covering topics similar to the topic your video is covering are a perfect place to embed a link to the video featured on your channel. What’s more, you can embed a link in your blog posts, on your website, or on a website of a partner company.</p><p><strong>Backlinks:</strong> A backlink is a link from some other website to the particular web resource, in this case, your video. You can insert links that offer additional information about the topic and by doing so increase the traffic.</p><p><strong>Third-party Website Promotion:</strong> Share links to videos you upload to YouTube on websites like Quora or forums such as Filmora.io.</p><p><strong>Team up with Other YouTube Creators:</strong> Looking for cooperation on Fiverr, or just send them private messages to ask for recommendation&#x2F;follow. Add your video in their playlist, or in Related Channel, End-screen card, etc.</p><h3 id="How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-3"><a href="#How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Monitor a Video’s Data?"></a>How to Monitor a Video’s Data?</h3><p> YouTube Analytics is a tool that will enable you to find out more about the people who are watching your videos. How many of your subscribers have watched a video you added to your channel? How many viewers found a video you uploaded through search results? The answer to these questions can be easily found with this tool.</p><p> YouTube Analytics also provides insight into subscriber conversion rates, so you can know exactly which videos attracted the most subscribers. This feature is particularly important if you are still developing your channel since it can help you understand which type of videos inspired a viewer to take action and hit the Subscribe button</p><p> Combining the information supplied by the YouTube Analytics with the data Google Analytics can offer will allow you to get to know the viewers of your videos better, which can be useful when planning the topics of the videos you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel in the future. If you’d like to gain access to more advanced statistics, there are a lot of free and paid YouTube analytics tools that enable you to keep track of the number of video comments, rankings, dislikes, likes, video replies or favorites.</p><p> Each of these metrics serves as a building block of a successful YouTube channel because uploading a video during a weekend or during the working days may not produce the same results. The YouTube analytics tools can assist you in staying one step ahead of your competition and increasing the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel.</p><h4 id="A-Few-Final-Thoughts-3"><a href="#A-Few-Final-Thoughts-3" class="headerlink" title="A Few Final Thoughts"></a>A Few Final Thoughts</h4><p> Just keep these fundamental things into your mind when you’re doing YouTube SEO:</p><p> YouTube will do anything they can to keep viewer watch longer</p><p><strong>So what’s relevant to the content? YouTube</strong></p><p> Always suggest videos from the same creator (so you should use brand, channel name tags)</p><p> Evaluated what people watch next and which video they ignore.</p><p> Displays video with the similar titles and keywords&#x2F;tags</p><p><strong>So what’s relevant to the viewers? YouTube</strong></p><p> Learns your preferences, style, tasted</p><p> Considers what content might be interesting to an individual viewer: analyze viewing history, channel subscriptions, search history, viewing choices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-skyrocketing-popularity-youtube-visibility-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved  Skyrocketing Popularity  YouTube Visibility Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expedite-channel-growth-surpass-the-10k-view-threshold-now/"><u>2024 Approved  Expedite Channel Growth  Surpass the 10K View Threshold Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-improve-video-clarity-with-simplified-caption-steps/"><u>[New] Improve Video Clarity with Simplified Caption Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/maximizing-engagement-ideal-youtube-thumbnail-dimensions-for-2024/"><u>Maximizing Engagement  Ideal YouTube Thumbnail Dimensions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamlining-quality-youtubes-best-video-improvement-strategies/"><u>2024 Approved  Streamlining Quality  YouTube's Best Video Improvement Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-exclusive-resource-hub-downloadable-templates-for-youtubers/"><u>[New] Exclusive Resource Hub -

With over a billion downloads, TikTok is now more influential than ever. Here, you can consider all TikTok users to be prospective audiences or followers. Videos go viral every day, and a substantial portion of them come from a single source: TikTok.</p><p>The massively popular short-video app is the latest craze, with individuals from all over the world using it to watch and produce content. Instagram stars, YouTube stars, and even real-life movie stars have switched to this platform, so what’s stopping you? It has so much to offer. Both seem to work in a connected way as Tiktok stars are seen converting videos from <strong>YouTube to TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to Link a YouTube Video to TikTok Post?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2"> How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok?

Even though Tiktok’s operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app ‘VINE’ was shut down back in 2016.</p><p>You can reap multiple benefits if you’re a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post. Let’s look at your options of connecting videos from <strong>YouTube to TikTok</strong> and highlight h<strong>ow to connect TikTok to YouTube.</strong></p><p>Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your phone and tap on your <strong>profile</strong> option.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the <strong>edit profile</strong> option and further select <strong>Add YouTube to Your Profile</strong> option.</p><p>Note: If you haven’t previously linked your YouTube account to your TikTok channel, tapping on this will very certainly take you to another page with the <strong>Google login screen</strong>.</p><p>Step 3: Click on <strong>“Allow” option</strong>. By tapping on this, your YouTube channel will display as a link in your bio area.</p><p>Note: However, as we continue with this knowledge, it is worth noting that when you put your channel description and links under the videos you publish, the link is not <strong>always clickable</strong>. It is recommended that you keep with the bio section and conclude your short films by urging your viewers to visit your YouTube channel, which is included in the bio of your Tiktok profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-YouTube-Video-and-Post-to-TikTok-3-ways"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-YouTube-Video-and-Post-to-TikTok-3-ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok? [3 ways]"></a>Part 2: How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok? [3 ways]</h2><p>Further, we feel that differences in posting (such as formats, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratios <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and durations) should be accounted for when YouTube videos are converted into TikTok videos. Tiktok offers a 9:16 aspect ratio compared to most videos on YouTube, where the aspect ratio is primarily 16:9.</p><p>As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas. Tiktok is a platform that promotes videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, compared to its initial support for content up to 15 seconds only. You will most likely have to resize your video if you plan to share it on Tiktok with all the above elements. Here are some of the video dimension details for TikTok.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 1080 x 1920</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 9:16 Aspect Ratio</li><li><strong>File Format:</strong>.mp4 or .mov</li><li><strong>Code</strong>:  encoded</li></ul><p>We might have left you perplexed with all the information about <strong>how to connect TikTok to YouTube</strong>, but don’t worry, here are a variety of apps and a step-by-step guide for posting your videos on Tiktok without any issues.</p><h3 id="1-Kapwing-Studio"><a href="#1-Kapwing-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1.

Even though Tiktok’s operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app ‘VINE’ was shut down back in 2016.</p><p>You can reap multiple benefits if you’re a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post. Let’s look at your options of connecting videos from <strong>YouTube to TikTok</strong> and highlight h<strong>ow to connect TikTok to YouTube.</strong></p><p>Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your phone and tap on your <strong>profile</strong> option.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the <strong>edit profile</strong> option and further select <strong>Add YouTube to Your Profile</strong> option.</p><p>Note: If you haven’t previously linked your YouTube account to your TikTok channel, tapping on this will very certainly take you to another page with the <strong>Google login screen</strong>.</p><p>Step 3: Click on <strong>“Allow” option</strong>. By tapping on this, your YouTube channel will display as a link in your bio area.</p><p>Note: However, as we continue with this knowledge, it is worth noting that when you put your channel description and links under the videos you publish, the link is not <strong>always clickable</strong>. It is recommended that you keep with the bio section and conclude your short films by urging your viewers to visit your YouTube channel, which is included in the bio of your Tiktok profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-YouTube-Video-and-Post-to-TikTok-3-ways-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-YouTube-Video-and-Post-to-TikTok-3-ways-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok?

Tiktok offers a 9:16 aspect ratio compared to most videos on YouTube, where the aspect ratio is primarily 16:9.</p><p>As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas. Tiktok is a platform that promotes videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, compared to its initial support for content up to 15 seconds only. You will most likely have to resize your video if you plan to share it on Tiktok with all the above elements.

The scientific explanations of ASMR and the list of its potential causes of this reaction are not as extensive as they can be.</p><p>Moreover, the visual and audio content that is designed to trigger the ASMR is perceived as unusual which further contributes to the controversy associated with this genre of videos. You are at the right place if you would like to learn more about ASMR because in this article we are going to take you through all the things you need to know about ASMR.</p><h2 id="How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work"><a href="#How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do ASMR Videos Work?"></a>How Do ASMR Videos Work?</h2><p>As strange as it may sound, millions of people around the globe are watching videos of someone whispering into a microphone, and apparently, it is helping them deal with stress, anxiety, and insomnia.</p><p>However, watching a video in any setting isn’t enough to trigger ASMR. You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing. Whether or not ASMR videos can achieve this goal is debatable.</p><h2 id="Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone"><a href="#Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone" class="headerlink" title="Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?"></a>Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?</h2><p>The short and simple answer is no. In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep. Whether or not the ASMR video will achieve the desired effect largely depends on the person watching it, because the AMSR trigger the video features may not affect the viewer who is sensitive to different types of stimuli.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers"><a href="#The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers" class="headerlink" title="The Most Common ASMR Triggers"></a>The Most Common ASMR Triggers</h2><p>It is still unclear what can trigger an ASMR since scientific research in this field has been scarce. Hence, it is difficult to know exactly what and under which circumstances can initiate such a reaction.</p><p>However, this phenomenon can be triggered by the following stimuli:</p><h3 id="1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice"><a href="#1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice"></a>1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice</h3><p>This is by far the most common ASMR trigger. Speaking in a low soft voice will likely create a tingling and pleasant sensation that will ultimately relax the listener. Consequently, the vast majority of ASMR video hosts are whispering or speaking softly into the microphone.</p><h3 id="2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks"><a href="#2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks" class="headerlink" title="2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks"></a>2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks</h3><p>The sounds created while turning the pages of a book, crumpling a piece of paper, or typing on a mechanical keyboard can all be potential ASMR triggers. It seems that the pleasant sensation is associated with the repetitiveness of these sounds, as they create a calming atmosphere.</p><h3 id="3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task"><a href="#3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task" class="headerlink" title="3. Watching someone perform an everyday task"></a>3. Watching someone perform an everyday task</h3><p>Seeing someone draw, paint, chop up food, or even write on a piece of paper can trigger the ASMR. Some people find the visual aspect of these actions relaxing, which in turn helps them get rid of the stress and sleep better.</p><h3 id="4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking"><a href="#4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking" class="headerlink" title="4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking"></a>4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking</h3><p>Chewing food loudly or slurping can generate a tingling sensation at the top of your head that later spreads through the entire body.</p><h3 id="5-Getting-attention"><a href="#5-Getting-attention" class="headerlink" title="5. Getting attention"></a>5. Getting attention</h3><p>Although almost everyone likes receiving attention, some people have a strong ASMR reaction to being the center of someone’s attention.</p><h3 id="6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors"><a href="#6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors" class="headerlink" title="6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors"></a>6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors</h3><p>Some people have the ability to trigger ASMR consciously without having to resort to audio or visual stimuli. However, this is quite rare as most members of the ASMR community rely on video and audio content to trigger the ASMR.</p><h3 id="7-Tapping-on-a-surface"><a href="#7-Tapping-on-a-surface" class="headerlink" title="7. Tapping on a surface"></a>7. Tapping on a surface</h3><p>Tapping on the surface of a microphone or the surface of plastic or metal objects is yet another common ASMR trigger. The reparative tapping sound initiates a pleasant sensation that relaxes a person.</p><h3 id="8-A-hand-touching-a-face"><a href="#8-A-hand-touching-a-face" class="headerlink" title="8. A hand touching a face"></a>8. A hand touching a face</h3><p>Tactile stimuli like a hand touching a face are known to be ASMR triggers. Besides touching a face, touching someone’s hand or hair can also trigger ASMR.</p><h3 id="9-Hearing-a-particular-genre-of-music"><a href="#9-Hearing-a-particular-genre-of-music" class="headerlink" title="9. Hearing a particular genre of music"></a>9. Hearing a particular genre of music</h3><p>People who love music often have a physical reaction to it. Hearing your favorite genre of music can produce the ASMR sensation.</p><h3 id="10-Listening-to-someone-exhale-into-a-mic"><a href="#10-Listening-to-someone-exhale-into-a-mic" class="headerlink" title="10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic"></a>10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic</h3><p>This ASMR trigger is frequently used in ASMR videos. Like all other audio ASMR triggers, blowing air into a microphone can help a person relax and fall asleep.</p><h2 id="What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular"><a href="#What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?"></a>What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?</h2><p>A little over a year ago there were more than 13 million ASMR videos on YouTube, which shows vividly how popular this genre of video has become. Moreover, the videos containing hosts and animals eating different types of food have amassed billions of views.</p><p>The stressful lives we all lead, boredom, or simply the need to experience something different are the most common reasons why people watch ASMR videos. In addition, the viewers of these videos suggest that they help them deal with depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems. Over the course of the last decade, the ASMR videos have risen from obscurity to become one of the most popular genres of YouTube videos largely due to their uniqueness and their relaxing nature.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos"><a href="#Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find ASMR videos?"></a>Where to Find ASMR videos?</h2><p>A simple google search will reveal a variety of ASMR videos, since all major video hosting platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, or Vimeo offer a broad selection of ASMR videos. Their contents vary from simple videos of hosts whispering into a microphone to carefully planned and staged role plays. Also, you try installing the app called Tingles on your Smartphone if you want to have access to a huge collection of ASMR triggers.</p><p>Moreover, ASMR videos can be found on websites that host pornographic content, which is the consequence of the sexualization of this phenomenon. Therefore where to look for ASMR videos depends on the type of ASMR content you’re looking for. One thing is certain, you won’t have much trouble finding ASMR videos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the decade, ASMR was a little known phenomenon very few people knew about. Today, ASMR videos attract huge audiences from all around the world, as they’ve become one of the most popular types of videos on YouTube and other video hosting platforms.</p><p>Despite the enormous popularity of ASMR content, we still have much to learn about the phenomenon itself and what triggers it. The little information that is available indicates that not everyone is capable of having an autonomous sensory meridian response to audio or visual stimuli. Furthermore, the potential triggers vary from whispering to watching someone prepare food, which contributes to the mystery surrounding the phenomenon.</p><p>Hopefully, this article has helped you develop a better understanding of ASMR.

What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.</p><p>Choosing the background image from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora’s native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube’s suggested thumbnail size.</p><p>It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don’t have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.</p><p>Filmora’s tools for editing the video thumbnail aren’t too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more. You can use Wondershare Filmora’s AI Portrait feature to easily change it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="What-is-Filmora’s-AI-Portrait-Feature-2"><a href="#What-is-Filmora’s-AI-Portrait-Feature-2" class="headerlink" title="What is Filmora’s AI Portrait Feature?"></a>What is Filmora’s AI Portrait Feature?</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora’s AI Portrait feature allows you to quickly remove and change the background of an image.</p><p>Normally, you would need a green screen or chroma key to do that. Another method is to manually erase the background using an eraser. The AI Portrait feature has an effect called “human segmentation.” It separates the humans in an image from the background.

And the photos are high-quality too, and they’re meant to be used as backgrounds.</p><p>Please note, however, that if you’re looking for vector illustrations, you’d better be on another site. NegativeSpace is built by a community of photographers. So, most of the resources you can download from this website are photos captured by a camera.</p><h2 id="How-To-Change-YouTube-Thumbnail-Background-3"><a href="#How-To-Change-YouTube-Thumbnail-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?"></a>How To Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?</h2><p>Suppose you have downloaded a high-quality image that will work great as a thumbnail background for your YouTube video. What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.</p><p>Choosing the background image from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora’s native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube’s suggested thumbnail size.</p><p>It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don’t have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.</p><p>Filmora’s tools for editing the video thumbnail aren’t too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more. You can use Wondershare Filmora’s AI Portrait feature to easily change it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="What-is-Filmora’s-AI-Portrait-Feature-3"><a href="#What-is-Filmora’s-AI-Portrait-Feature-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Filmora’s AI Portrait Feature?"></a>What is Filmora’s AI Portrait Feature?</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora’s AI Portrait feature allows you to quickly remove and change the background of an image.</p><p>Normally, you would need a green screen or chroma key to do that. Another method is to manually erase the background using an eraser. The AI Portrait feature has an effect called “human segmentation.” It separates the humans in an image from the background. Then, you can delete or change the background with the thumbnail background that you have downloaded. It’s really convenient!</p><p>Here is a guide on changing a YouTube thumbnail background using Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>1.
