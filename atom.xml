Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image.

Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn’t require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.</p><hr><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section.

The only trouble is that both Instagram and IGTV have very precise <strong>video upload requirements</strong>, so each video you want to share on your IGTV channel must be <strong>saved in MP4 file format and in a 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>.</p><p>YouTube videos, on the other hand, are mostly horizontally oriented. If you attempt to <strong>upload a YouTube video to IGTV</strong> and wondering how to achieve it, just keep reading. Because in this article, we are going to show you how you can convert a horizontal YouTube video into IGTV vertical one in 3 different ways.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Re-post YouTube Video to IGTV with Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use YouTube to IGTV Online Converter</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Convert YouTube Video to IGTV with FXP</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Convert-YouTube-Videos-to-IGTV-Vertical-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-Convert-YouTube-Videos-to-IGTV-Vertical-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Convert YouTube Videos to IGTV Vertical Videos with Filmora"></a>Part 1: Convert YouTube Videos to IGTV Vertical Videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>If you don’t already have the original file of the video you’d like to upload to your IGTV channel, you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download a video from YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but keep in mind that you can’t use any content without permission from its owner.</p><p>Once you have the file, you can <strong>create a new project</strong> in Filmora and then after the project loads you should click on the <strong>File menu</strong> and select the <strong>Project Settings option</strong>.

There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to <strong>set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. During the video editing process, you will have to <strong>resize all of the footage</strong> you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.</p><p>If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media. Do you know another way of changing a YouTube video’s aspect ratio before re-posting it on IGTV?

Have a Consistent Layout"></a>1. Have a Consistent Layout</h2><p>Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.</p><p>An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg"                      alt="Consistent Layout"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043603/7443" target="_top" id="2043603">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043603" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043603/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141688/17094" target="_top" id="2141688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141688/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#2-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Your Face"></a><strong>2. Use Your Face</strong></h2><p>People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out more tips like this here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic"><a href="#3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic"></a>3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic</h2><p>Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.</p><p>Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#4-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Your Text Huge"></a>4. Make Your Text Huge</h2><p>If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037335/7443" target="_top" id="2037335">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037335" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037335/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep it Clutter-Free"></a>5. Keep it Clutter-Free</h2><p>It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.</p><p>A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.</p><p> <a class="link"

Gena’s most important piece of advice for other beauty vloggers is, to be honest. There is nothing wrong with making money from affiliates or sponsors, so long as you only associate with and recommend products you would actually buy.</p><p>Here’s more advice on how you can make money from your makeup videos:</p><h2 id="Sponsorships-3"><a href="#Sponsorships-3" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorships"></a>Sponsorships</h2><p>If you are truly passionate about makeup or fashion then you probably have a few favorite brands. Even if you have never really thought about a brand as your favorite, chances are you purchase one or two types of lip gloss – or any other product – over others on a regular basis.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be nice if a company whose product you already love and use in your videos would start paying you just to mention them?</p><p>There are sites called influencer marketing platforms – the most popular one is FameBit – where you can find brands that are looking for creators just like you to work with them on marketing campaigns. Brands post what they are looking for, and you send them proposals for what kinds of videos you want to make for them.</p><p>Sometimes, creating branded content can be as easy as drawing attention to the brand of the eyeliner you use in a few of your tutorials.</p><p>Other times, brands may want you to say specific things or include logos in your videos.</p><p>Make sure to incorporate any brand messages or product placement you agree to do in ways that will feel natural to your viewers.

Everyone knows that big YouTubers get paid through the ads that play ahead of their videos. More and more YouTubers keep showing how much money they are making from YouTube via the lifestyles they lead. It begs the question - how much money do YouTubers make?</p><p>One of the main questions is “how many views do you need to start making money on YouTube?” The answer to this question is complicated. You need 4,000 hours of annual viewing time and 1,000 subscribers on your channel to sign up for monetization, but just being able to monetize your videos doesn’t mean you’re going to make money.</p><p>The reason is that YouTubers are not paid per view, they are paid per ad impression.</p><ul><li><a href="#types">Types of YouTube Ads - What is an Ad Impression?</a></li><li><a href="#cpi">CPI Rates Explained</a></li><li><a href="#bigyoutubers">How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?</a></li><li><a href="#milestone">Why No Longer 10,000 Views?</a></li></ul><p>Want a fast answer about how much money a YouTuber makes? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out these calculators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Types-of-YouTube-Ads-–-What-is-an-Ad-Impression"><a href="#Types-of-YouTube-Ads-–-What-is-an-Ad-Impression" class="headerlink" title="Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?"></a>Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?</h2><p>If you ask YouTubers about how much they make per thousand views, you’ll probably get a different answer depending on the person on who you ask. You may have already heard things like $5 per thousand views or $1,000 per 1 million views, but neither of these is for sure.</p><p>Google’s AdSense service, through which YouTubers make money, pays YouTubers for ad impressions. For most types of ads – including short pre-roll ads, the ads which appear at the bottoms of videos while they play, and the ads which appear as banners to the side of YouTube’s player – an ad impression means someone clicking on the ad and choosing to visit the advertiser’s site. One exception is skippable video ads, for which an impression is created when a viewer watches the ad for 30 seconds.</p><p>YouTubers do not make money on the views of their videos, because not all viewers click on ads. Many viewers bypass ads completely using ad-blockers. The amount of money YouTubers earn from a single ad impression is called their CPI or “cost per impression.”</p><h2 id="CPI-Rates-Explained"><a href="#CPI-Rates-Explained" class="headerlink" title="CPI Rates Explained"></a>CPI Rates Explained</h2><p>YouTube advertising is currently managed inside the AdSense platform. In case you’re not familiar with AdSense, you can have 2 different kinds of ads - the cost per click (CPC) or the cost per view (CPV).</p><h4 id="Cost-Per-Click-ads"><a href="#Cost-Per-Click-ads" class="headerlink" title="Cost Per Click ads"></a>Cost Per Click ads</h4><p>The advertiser pays based on how many clicks he was able to get with that particular ad. These kinds of ads usually appear on the right side of your YouTube channel or they can also appear at the bottom of the screen, during the video.</p><h4 id="Cost-Per-View-ads"><a href="#Cost-Per-View-ads" class="headerlink" title="Cost Per View ads"></a>Cost Per View ads</h4><p>the advertiser will pay based on the views he had of the ad and not based on the clicks he was able to generate. One of the things that many people aren’t aware of is the fact that the viewer needs to spend at least 30 seconds watching the ad or half the ad, whichever comes first. This means that a single viewer can continue clicking on the ad multiple times that the advertiser won’t be billed for all those clicks because he is only paying for views.</p><h4 id="Never-Click-on-the-CPC-ads-of-Your-Own-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Never-Click-on-the-CPC-ads-of-Your-Own-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos"></a>Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos</h4><p>If any of your friends ever suggest that they are going to do so to help you out tell them not to. AdSense has a rate of ad-clicks that it considers normal and if you get significantly more clicks than that it will think you’re artificially pushing that number up by either clicking yourself or having someone do it for you. If this happens they will ban you from AdSense and, although there is an appeals process, it is unlikely you will ever get your account back and be able to monetize videos again.</p><p>How much you make from an ad on YouTube depends on your CPI, cost per impression. Simply put, this is the rate that YouTube will pay you for every 1,000 views or clicks of the ads that are attached to your videos. Even though it would be a lot simpler if YouTube had their current CPI rates available, they don’t. These rates vary depending on the ad, the types of videos you make, and how popular your channel is. It is actually against YouTube’s rules for YouTubers to share their personal CPI rates publicly.</p><p>Most people tend to assume that CPI rates are between $0.05 and $10. This huge difference is justified by YouTube by saying that they use a very complicated algorithm to determine your CPI rate. According to them, it includes evaluating factors like the ads, the type of audience who views your video, audience engagement, audience retention, and the price of the ads.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Much-Do-Big-YouTubers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-Big-YouTubers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?"></a>How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?</h2><p>Many people are aspiring to make money as famous YouTubers, but it is not an easy task. You have a long way to go before you start making any money at all.</p><p>In general, it’s reasonable to expect to start earning some money when you get to 1 million subscribers. This is the point at which you can start treating YouTube as your job, but the truth is that you will still not be making amazing money. At 1 million subscribers you will only be starting to be seen as someone important in your industry. You won’t even necessarily be “YouTube famous” yet – there are a lot of channels with 1 million subs.</p><p>Even though most people think that YouTube channels with 1 million subscribers are already making a good amount of money and that they are already at the top, the truth is that they’ve just started climbing. They aren’t even near the top. Just to give you a better idea, there are more than 2,400 YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers.</p><p>According to Google, when an advertiser pays $100 to Google, Google pays $68 to the publisher (in this case, the publisher is a YouTube creator).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-much-do-youtubers-make.png"                      alt="How Much Do YouTuber Makes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135366/19272" target="_top" id="2135366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>This graphic won’t apply to every situation because every situation is unique.

Only about 15% of viewers tend to watch the complete ad (or, at least half of it). So, considering that you have 1,000 views on your video, only 150 viewers watched your complete ad. So, at $0.18 per view, Google will charge $27 to the advertiser and the YouTube channel will get 51% of that, meaning the creator will earn $13 per 1,000 views.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to know how much YouTube pays for 1 million views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</p><p>It will take you a long time to start earning enough money to support yourself through AdSense. That’s why AdSense isn’t the primary way that huge YouTube stars make money. In addition to AdSense revenue you can (and should) also consider other opportunities such as product placement, endorsements, and brand sponsorships. Many YouTubers also make some money from selling their merchandise.</p><p>Some YouTubers earn millions of dollars every year. Although the exact numbers have never been disclosed, many different websites have made educated guesses.</p><p>Forbes publishes an annual list of the highest-paid YouTubers, which includes revenue from things like book deals and makeup lines. It is useful to look at this list gain have some perspective about how big YouTubers make their money, and how big they had to get to make it.</p><p>As of 2017, YouTube gamer Daniel Middleton (DanTDM) is the highest-paid YouTuber earning 16 million dollars. He is followed by gamer Evan Fong (Vanoss Gaming) with $15.5 million, Dude Perfect with $14 million, and Mark Fischbach (Markiplier) and Logan Paul with $12.5 million. However, as we already mentioned, even though a substantial part of the income of these YouTube stars comes from YouTube&#x2F;AdSense, the bulk of it comes from things like merchandise and sponsorships.</p><p>Instead of relying on YouTube to pay them, YouTubers need to seek out other ways of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >leveraging the YouTube platform to earn money <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>We all agree that being a YouTube star isn’t an easy path. However, if you honestly love what you do, then you will be willing to put effort into making great videos regularly. Part of that is also being willing to take the time to promote them and yourself, as well as putting time and effort into forging a good relationship with your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983539">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983539%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983539/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-No-Longer-10-000-Views"><a href="#Why-No-Longer-10-000-Views" class="headerlink" title="Why No Longer 10,000 Views?"></a>Why No Longer 10,000 Views?</h2><p>YouTube used to let anybody monetize their videos, but that has now changed. Then for a while, you’ll qualify for monetization after reaching 10,000-lifetime views on your channel. But as of 2018, the rules to YouTube monetization has gotten more challenging.</p><p>To monetize you must have:</p><p>- 4,000 of annual watch time</p><p>- 1,000 subscribers</p><p>The reason for this is that YouTube was having trouble with channels that were trying to monetize stolen or inappropriate content, besides, YouTubers are gaming the system by using automated programs to gain more views. By making creators get more watch time and subscribers before they apply for monetization, YouTube has been able to create a review process in which they can prove that the channel has a legitimate audience and stop content thieves and criminals from making money. Naturally, this new rule also makes it very difficult for new YouTubers to make money.</p><p><em>Are you finding it difficult to earn money on YouTube?

Collect Ideas"></a>1. Collect Ideas</h3><p>Before you write the script, it’s a good idea to gather ideas. If you think of something, or if something funny happens, write it down right away. Keep a pen and notebook handy that way you will not forget about it.</p><h3 id="2-Find-an-area-that-is-not-distracting-2"><a href="#2-Find-an-area-that-is-not-distracting-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Find an area that is not distracting</h3><p>Once you have gathered enough ideas for the YouTube video, the next step is to find a place where you can write in peace and be inspired. Avoid any distractions to ensure that you will be able to put all your thoughts and ideas onto paper.</p><h2 id="Writing-a-Script-for-a-YouTube-Video-2"><a href="#Writing-a-Script-for-a-YouTube-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Writing a Script for a YouTube Video"></a>Writing a Script for a YouTube Video</h2><p>Now that you’re ready to sit down and write, here’s what you do:</p><h3 id="1-Create-an-outline-for-your-story-2"><a href="#1-Create-an-outline-for-your-story-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Create an outline for your story"></a>1. Create an outline for your story</h3><p>The first step in writing a script is to develop an outline for the story. You might think that it is an unnecessary step, but it’s one of the most important steps to writing a script. The outline serves as a guide that will make the finished product better compared to when you just tried to wing it. One tip on how to write a script for a YouTube video is to have an outline for the beginning, middle, and ending of the video. Once you have all the elements of the story, then you can start with the first draft of the script.</p><h3 id="2-Set-the-tone-2"><a href="#2-Set-the-tone-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Set the tone"></a>2. Set the tone</h3><p>The tone you pick for the video will depend on your audience. It’s safe to assume that viewers want something that’s unique, informative, and engaging. In some cases, they look for a video that’s personal, and they can relate to it. Humor is also something that you should consider when writing a script.</p><h3 id="3-Just-keep-writing-2"><a href="#3-Just-keep-writing-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Just keep writing"></a>3. Just keep writing</h3><p>When you start writing it is important that you keep on doing it no matter what happens. Just write down everything that comes into your mind. After that, read what you’ve written. If you think that something needs to be replaced, then replace it. If you get more inspiration and think that the script is lacking, then add to it.</p><h3 id="4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured-2"><a href="#4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Make sure that the script is well structured"></a>4. Make sure that the script is well structured</h3><p>It’s important to learn how to write a script that is well structured. Divide the script into four parts: Opening, Primer, Body, and Closing.</p><p>For the Opening part, ask a simple question that can be answered in the Body. Use the Primer section to inform viewers what they should expect from the video. The Body will contain the main content of the video. It should cover all the things that viewers need to know. Lastly, the closing wraps up the video by providing social media details and a teaser for the next video.</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep It Concise</strong></li></ul><p>In a personal vlog-style video you might ramble and go off on amusing tangents, and that’s something viewers love within that genre. If you are trying to teach, however, your viewers will benefit more if you keep things concise and direct.</p><p>Tell people up front what point you are trying to make before you jump into making it.</p><ul><li><strong>Be Interactive</strong></li></ul><p>Talk to people, not at them.</p><p>While you are scripting and focusing on the information you want to deliver, it’s easy to forget to be personal.</p><p>Remember to refer to your audience as ‘you’, not ‘you guys’ (you are speaking to individual viewers, not a collective) and to include moments of engagement throughout your videos.

There are a lot of action&#x2F;military-themed effects (like explosions), as well as sci-fi and fantasy-themed things like dragons.</p><p>Beyond that, there are a lot of animals and nature-themed effects.</p><h2 id="ALLDesignCreative-3"><a href="#ALLDesignCreative-3" class="headerlink" title="ALLDesignCreative"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/alldesigncreative" >ALLDesignCreative <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Here you’ll find things like fog, ripples, waves, and falling flowers – in short, overlays. There are lots of cool overlays included in Filmora, or available through our effects store, and if you go hunting through this and other free green screens&#x2F;chroma key effect channels you can find even more.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> to obtain most of these effects, you will need to use a service that allows you to save&#x2F;download YouTube videos.</p><p>One of the easiest ways to save videos is by using Save From. Just go to the watch page for the video and type ‘ss’ in front of YouTube in the address bar (so your address looks like <strong><a class="link"   href="http://www.ssyoutube/" >http://www.ssyoutube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>). You will be taken to a page where you can download the video for free, so long as you don’t want it in HD. You have to pay for the service if you want a higher quality clip, but most of these green screen effects will look fine in 720p.</p><p>Have you made anything cool recently using a green screen?

The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.</p><p>In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.</p><p>Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.</p><p>There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention.

The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.</p><p>In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.</p><p>Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.</p><p>There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations"><a href="#Technical-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations-1"><a href="#Technical-Considerations-1" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility-1"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback-1"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync-1"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download. Remember what you learned here, and make sure you use the tools we suggested to find the best templates.

You can also try uploading from your college campus or public libraries as institutions like these tend to have fast internet speeds.</p><h4 id="2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored-3"><a href="#2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Where is Your Video Stored?</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-works.JPG"                      alt="how youtube works"                ></p><p>As it is owned by Google YouTube uses Google’s ‘Bigtable’, a compressed data storage system which allows it to store the 500+ hours of video uploaded to its servers every minute. Bigtable is software, though, not hardware. YouTube and Google both have massive amounts of data and it needs to be physically housed somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videos-uploaded-to-youtube.jpg"                      alt="videos uploaded to youtube"                ></p><p>Google has Modular Data Centers all over the world where it keeps its servers. These centers could cost as much as $600 million dollars each and consume huge amounts of electricity. There are six of them in the United States, three in Europe, two in Asia, and one is South America.</p><h4 id="3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video-3"><a href="#3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?"></a>3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-from-concept-to-completion-crafting-youtube-shorts-templates-masterfully/"><u>[New] From Concept to Completion Crafting YouTube Shorts Templates Masterfully</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-maximize-video-impact-via-creator-studio-utilization/"><u>[New] Maximize Video Impact via Creator Studio Utilization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-screening-success-10-movies-that-energize-and-empower/"><u>[New] Screening Success 10 Movies That Energize & Empower</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-smart-strategies-for-entrepreneurial-video-marketing/"><u>[New] SMART Strategies for Entrepreneurial Video Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-instagrams-hidden-qanda-features/"><u>[New] Unlocking Instagram’s Hidden Q&A Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovator-in-visual-symphony-production/"><u>2024 Approved Innovator in Visual Symphony Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tailored-techniques-for-thriving-on-igtv/"><u>2024 Approved Tailored Techniques for Thriving on IGTV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-poco-c65-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Poco C65?

Just go to the watch page for the video and type ‘ss’ in front of YouTube in the address bar (so your address looks like <strong><a class="link"   href="http://www.ssyoutube/" >http://www.ssyoutube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>). You will be taken to a page where you can download the video for free, so long as you don’t want it in HD. You have to pay for the service if you want a higher quality clip, but most of these green screen effects will look fine in 720p.</p><p>Have you made anything cool recently using a green screen?
