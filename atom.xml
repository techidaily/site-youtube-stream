To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

The search results also include the number of videos featured on the YouTube channel as well as the number of views. Subscriber Counter is an easy-to-use tool, but just don’t expect much more than basic information from this live subscriber tracker.</p><h3 id="3-Akshatmittal-com"><a href="#3-Akshatmittal-com" class="headerlink" title="3.

However, if you want to learn more about a YouTube channel than its subscriber count, such as the number of videos a creator has uploaded, how many views they have received, or how many comments their videos have, then LiveCounts may not be a good choice since it only monitors subscriber numbers in real time. There is a views tool, but it does not appear to be working.</p><p>On LiveCounts you can change the color of the display background.</p><h3 id="5-Grin-co"><a href="#5-Grin-co" class="headerlink" title="5.

And the green screen is one common practice. Green screen technology is a technique where you use two images or video streams to composite them together. You can use any background images, either foreground or behind the actors. For YouTube, you can use green screen subscribe to facilitate video Call To Action. A green screen easily produces impossible scenes and expands filming ideas. Everything done at the Studio is also the best way to protect actors from hazardous environments.</p><p>More so, the best trick is to allow actors to appear together on the screen even when the scenes were captured separately. And did you know that subscribe green screen makes it easy to add YouTube Call To Action and direct viewers on what to do?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-1.png"                      alt="subscribe green screen"                ></p><h2 id="Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video"><a href="#Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Methods to add a subscribe button to your video"></a>Methods to add a subscribe button to your video</h2><p>Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.</p><h4 id="1-Use-Subscribe-Green-Screen"><a href="#1-Use-Subscribe-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1 Use Subscribe Green Screen"></a>1 Use Subscribe Green Screen</h4><p>Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Set screen</strong><br>You need to create a background at the Studio – and that’s the green screen. Keenly hand it on a frame before you start filming. Also, note that no wrinkles or fold-ups are visible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-2.png"                      alt="how to make subscribe green screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Adjust lighting</strong><br>Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up the subject</strong><br>Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn’t professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-3.png"                      alt="make your own green screen - set up the object"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Start filming</strong><br>Begin to film your video and ensure you take various shots for comparison. It is good to film at different angles to see what works best.</p><p><strong>Step 5. Polish the rough cut</strong><br>Tune all the footage to perfect video clips. It will save your efforts when keying out green screen footage. Remove the unwanted parts by trimming. You can also do other edits like merge and split where necessary.</p><p><strong>Step 6. Key out the footage and edit the green screen</strong><br>Your footage is now ready, and you are now free to edit the green screen. It is better to engage reliable editing software to remove the green traces in the shot.</p><p><strong>Step 7. Paste the new background</strong><br>Any background concept can now fit in. Add your desired background video or image in a new layer below the subject. You can continue to make other necessary adjustments like sharpness and hue for reality.</p><p><strong>Step 8. Add Call To Action</strong><br>Finally, tell your viewers to subscribe to your YouTube channel while watching the video. You can also introduce your other channels that aren’t yet known or those that have not reached 1,000 subscribers.</p><h4 id="2-Using-YouTube-Studio"><a href="#2-Using-YouTube-Studio" class="headerlink" title="2 Using YouTube Studio"></a>2 Using YouTube Studio</h4><p>You can also enable the green screen to subscribe via the YouTube Studio. It is a YouTube application that provides you with the tools you need to create a successful YouTube channel. You can manage your videos, respond to comments and even add adverts to your content for pay. Here are the steps to add subscribe button.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>. First, go directly to “studio.youtube.com” or click on your profile picture on the YouTube page to launch YT Studio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-5.png"                      alt="add subscirbe button using youtube studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Click on the “Menu” option and choose the “Settings”&gt; “Channel” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-6.png"                      alt="add subscirbe button using youtube studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Then select the “Choose” image and select which subscribe button image you wish to use as your branding watermark. You can easily get one on the Google images section.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Next, choose the display time for the branding watermark. It could be a custom start time if you want the branding watermark to start showing at a specific time. You can also choose “End or video” for it to appear at the last 10 to 15 seconds of your video. Likewise, the branding watermark can show throughout the video if you choose the “Entire video” option.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>. Finally, save the changes. Voila! Viewers can subscribe to your channel easily, with a single click of a button.</p><h4 id="3-Using-Subscribe-Effects"><a href="#3-Using-Subscribe-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3 Using Subscribe Effects"></a>3 Using Subscribe Effects</h4><p>You can also use the subscribers’ effects to add a Call To Action. Remember, your main aim is to increase the audience to your channel. And in most cases, viewers forget to subscribe even though they love your video. Perhaps they don’t understand the importance it holds to your channel. You can do this using a reliable video editor software – Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is a sophisticated tool that is easy to use and export your videos to your computer and upload them to YouTube.

The scientific explanations of ASMR and the list of its potential causes of this reaction are not as extensive as they can be.</p><p>Moreover, the visual and audio content that is designed to trigger the ASMR is perceived as unusual which further contributes to the controversy associated with this genre of videos. You are at the right place if you would like to learn more about ASMR because in this article we are going to take you through all the things you need to know about ASMR.</p><h2 id="How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work"><a href="#How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do ASMR Videos Work?"></a>How Do ASMR Videos Work?</h2><p>As strange as it may sound, millions of people around the globe are watching videos of someone whispering into a microphone, and apparently, it is helping them deal with stress, anxiety, and insomnia.</p><p>However, watching a video in any setting isn’t enough to trigger ASMR. You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing. Whether or not ASMR videos can achieve this goal is debatable.</p><h2 id="Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone"><a href="#Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone" class="headerlink" title="Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?"></a>Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?</h2><p>The short and simple answer is no. In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep. Whether or not the ASMR video will achieve the desired effect largely depends on the person watching it, because the AMSR trigger the video features may not affect the viewer who is sensitive to different types of stimuli.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers"><a href="#The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers" class="headerlink" title="The Most Common ASMR Triggers"></a>The Most Common ASMR Triggers</h2><p>It is still unclear what can trigger an ASMR since scientific research in this field has been scarce. Hence, it is difficult to know exactly what and under which circumstances can initiate such a reaction.</p><p>However, this phenomenon can be triggered by the following stimuli:</p><h3 id="1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice"><a href="#1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice"></a>1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice</h3><p>This is by far the most common ASMR trigger. Speaking in a low soft voice will likely create a tingling and pleasant sensation that will ultimately relax the listener. Consequently, the vast majority of ASMR video hosts are whispering or speaking softly into the microphone.</p><h3 id="2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks"><a href="#2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks" class="headerlink" title="2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks"></a>2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks</h3><p>The sounds created while turning the pages of a book, crumpling a piece of paper, or typing on a mechanical keyboard can all be potential ASMR triggers. It seems that the pleasant sensation is associated with the repetitiveness of these sounds, as they create a calming atmosphere.</p><h3 id="3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task"><a href="#3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task" class="headerlink" title="3. Watching someone perform an everyday task"></a>3. Watching someone perform an everyday task</h3><p>Seeing someone draw, paint, chop up food, or even write on a piece of paper can trigger the ASMR. Some people find the visual aspect of these actions relaxing, which in turn helps them get rid of the stress and sleep better.</p><h3 id="4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking"><a href="#4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking" class="headerlink" title="4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking"></a>4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking</h3><p>Chewing food loudly or slurping can generate a tingling sensation at the top of your head that later spreads through the entire body.</p><h3 id="5-Getting-attention"><a href="#5-Getting-attention" class="headerlink" title="5. Getting attention"></a>5. Getting attention</h3><p>Although almost everyone likes receiving attention, some people have a strong ASMR reaction to being the center of someone’s attention.</p><h3 id="6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors"><a href="#6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors" class="headerlink" title="6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors"></a>6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors</h3><p>Some people have the ability to trigger ASMR consciously without having to resort to audio or visual stimuli. However, this is quite rare as most members of the ASMR community rely on video and audio content to trigger the ASMR.</p><h3 id="7-Tapping-on-a-surface"><a href="#7-Tapping-on-a-surface" class="headerlink" title="7. Tapping on a surface"></a>7. Tapping on a surface</h3><p>Tapping on the surface of a microphone or the surface of plastic or metal objects is yet another common ASMR trigger. The reparative tapping sound initiates a pleasant sensation that relaxes a person.</p><h3 id="8-A-hand-touching-a-face"><a href="#8-A-hand-touching-a-face" class="headerlink" title="8. A hand touching a face"></a>8. A hand touching a face</h3><p>Tactile stimuli like a hand touching a face are known to be ASMR triggers. Besides touching a face, touching someone’s hand or hair can also trigger ASMR.</p><h3 id="9-Hearing-a-particular-genre-of-music"><a href="#9-Hearing-a-particular-genre-of-music" class="headerlink" title="9. Hearing a particular genre of music"></a>9. Hearing a particular genre of music</h3><p>People who love music often have a physical reaction to it. Hearing your favorite genre of music can produce the ASMR sensation.</p><h3 id="10-Listening-to-someone-exhale-into-a-mic"><a href="#10-Listening-to-someone-exhale-into-a-mic" class="headerlink" title="10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic"></a>10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic</h3><p>This ASMR trigger is frequently used in ASMR videos. Like all other audio ASMR triggers, blowing air into a microphone can help a person relax and fall asleep.</p><h2 id="What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular"><a href="#What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?"></a>What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?</h2><p>A little over a year ago there were more than 13 million ASMR videos on YouTube, which shows vividly how popular this genre of video has become. Moreover, the videos containing hosts and animals eating different types of food have amassed billions of views.</p><p>The stressful lives we all lead, boredom, or simply the need to experience something different are the most common reasons why people watch ASMR videos. In addition, the viewers of these videos suggest that they help them deal with depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems. Over the course of the last decade, the ASMR videos have risen from obscurity to become one of the most popular genres of YouTube videos largely due to their uniqueness and their relaxing nature.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos"><a href="#Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find ASMR videos?"></a>Where to Find ASMR videos?</h2><p>A simple google search will reveal a variety of ASMR videos, since all major video hosting platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, or Vimeo offer a broad selection of ASMR videos. Their contents vary from simple videos of hosts whispering into a microphone to carefully planned and staged role plays. Also, you try installing the app called Tingles on your Smartphone if you want to have access to a huge collection of ASMR triggers.</p><p>Moreover, ASMR videos can be found on websites that host pornographic content, which is the consequence of the sexualization of this phenomenon. Therefore where to look for ASMR videos depends on the type of ASMR content you’re looking for. One thing is certain, you won’t have much trouble finding ASMR videos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the decade, ASMR was a little known phenomenon very few people knew about. Today, ASMR videos attract huge audiences from all around the world, as they’ve become one of the most popular types of videos on YouTube and other video hosting platforms.</p><p>Despite the enormous popularity of ASMR content, we still have much to learn about the phenomenon itself and what triggers it. The little information that is available indicates that not everyone is capable of having an autonomous sensory meridian response to audio or visual stimuli. Furthermore, the potential triggers vary from whispering to watching someone prepare food, which contributes to the mystery surrounding the phenomenon.</p><p>Hopefully, this article has helped you develop a better understanding of ASMR. If so, share your thought with us in the comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expand-audiences-quickly-using-short-form-content/"><u>2024 Approved  Expand Audiences Quickly Using Short Form Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-video-marketing-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Video Marketing on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/monetizing-video-how-much-does-a-single-streamer-earn-in-2024/"><u>Monetizing Video  How Much Does a Single Streamer Earn, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-youtubers-with-most-subscribers/"><u>In 2024, 10 YouTubers with Most Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-secrets-to-youtube-highlighted-remarks/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling the Secrets to YouTube Highlighted Remarks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-green-up-your-cta-strategy-with-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Green Up Your CTA Strategy with Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-pros-choice-the-ultimate-list-of-7-live-streaming-apps-for-youtube-iosandroid/"><u>[New] Pro's Choice  The Ultimate List of 7 Live Streaming Apps for YouTube (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-27-non-youtube-platforms-for-exceptional-video-content/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 27 Non-Youtube Platforms for Exceptional Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-formulating-engaging-visual-strategies-in-fb-marketing-for-2024/"><u>[New] Formulating Engaging Visual Strategies in FB Marketing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-upgrade-your-mac-with-macos-sierra-simplified/"><u>In 2024, How to Upgrade Your Mac with macOS Sierra Simplified</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-youtube-image-techniques-for-engaging-views/"><u>[Updated] YouTube Image Techniques for Engaging Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-fix-itoolab-anygo-not-working-on-nokia-c12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Full Guide to Fix iToolab AnyGO Not Working On Nokia C12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-loop-creating-impactful-content-for-instagram/"><u>Mastering the Art of Loop  Creating Impactful Content for Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-brightening-up-your-online-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Brightening Up Your Online Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-budget-friendly-digital-screen-reader/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Best Budget-Friendly Digital Screen Reader</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-android-lock-screen-using-emergency-call-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/best-ways-to-adjust-speed-on-snapchat-videos-and-the-best-alternative-for-2024/"><u>Best Ways to Adjust Speed on Snapchat Videos (And the Best Alternative for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

We’ve categorized this article into a total of 8 parts for simple and better understanding.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Does Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Does Highlighted Comments Look Like on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Comment Highlighted?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Highlighted Comments URL?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment</a></li><li><a href="#part8">Part 8: Benefits of Highlighted Comments</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?"></a>Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</h2><p>Before you get on with highlighting your comments, you must understand what it means exactly. You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links. The 2 URLs lead you to the same video, but only one of them shows a highlighted comment.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Notice the name “lc” in the first URL- that stands for linked comment. YouTube might include this additional parameter. If a reply comment (HR) gets highlighted, the parent comment gets raised to the top.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?"></a>Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?</h2><p>YouTube has been working on improving the navigation of the comment section for videos, and highlighted comments are one of them. These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video. If you want to get the highlighted URL for the comment, simply click on the timestamp (e.g., 2 weeks ago) beside the commentator’s username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>On the other hand, for a YouTuber, getting access to the comment URL is relatively straightforward. The host will get a notification on his or her registered email-id when a viewer publishes a comment on their posted video. You will find the link to the highlighted comment in the notification</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Replying to “highlighted comments” on your YouTube channel is pretty easy since this feature was developed, keeping the user’s convenience in mind. If you want to follow up or reply to such comments, you can do so from your email or YouTube Dashboard.</p><p>If you click the notification bell icon, whenever a viewer drops a new comment on one of your videos, YouTube will send you a notification via email. On opening the email, you will find a clickable “Reply” option. Or else, if you follow the comment section in the YouTube Dashboard, you can directly view or reply to highlighted comments from here as well.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why a highlighted comment always shows at the top of the comment list? Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it. The purpose is to remind you that you are here for that specific comment.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Can you, as a video maker, remove highlighted comments on YouTube? The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously). Doing this will ensure that you no longer see any highlighted comments. However, at the same time, this will restrict you from interacting in any way with that video, let alone leaving a comment.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment"><a href="#Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?"></a>Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?</h2><p>Many frequently inquire on the internet about how they can improve the chances of getting their comment pinned, as highlighted on YouTube. The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial. That is especially true if you are looking for ways to optimize your channel.</p><p>YouTube is undeniably the second largest search engine on the web. Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel. If your comment gets highlighted, your YouTube channel can be one of them.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>YouTube can be an intimidating tool for marketing and more so for newcomers. Every YouTuber wishes that their channel performs better than the previous day. Even though the highlighted comment or highlighted reply feature doesn’t have any direct benefits, it can indeed help in optimizing your YouTube channel.</p><p>It can connect you with potential viewers and increase the number of people that visit your channel regularly. However, how many of them stay and hit the “Subscribe” button is a different story altogether and is wholly based on whether they like what you share through your videos.</p><p>In this article, we have shared facts on YouTube’s commonly seen highlighted comment feature. Yet, the term is a heavily misleading one, as far as viewers and Youtuber’s are concerned. We have also covered all other aspects and queries related to this term. Here’s hoping they clarify all your doubts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-social-screening-highest-view-counts-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Social Screening  Highest View Counts on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-step-up-your-content-quality-with-these-8-mirrorless-cams/"><u>[New] Step Up Your Content Quality with These 8 Mirrorless Cams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-quality-videos-not-on-youtubey/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Quality Videos, Not on YouTubey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfect-your-youtube-clips-essential-editing-techniques-unveiled/"><u>2024 Approved  Perfect Your YouTube Clips  Essential Editing Techniques Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-stream-like-never-before-turning-on-youtubes-av1/"><u>2024 Approved  Stream Like Never Before  Turning On YouTube's AV1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-youtube-for-ultimate-virtual-reality-adventures/"><u>In 2024, Navigating YouTube for Ultimate Virtual Reality Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-pathway-merging-youtube-with-tiktok/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate Pathway  Merging YouTube with TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/harmonizing-your-music-a-youtube-playlist-journey-for-2024/"><u>Harmonizing Your Music  A YouTube Playlist Journey for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reliable-methods-to-elevate-your-youtube-presence-without-breaking-trust/"><u>2024 Approved  Reliable Methods to Elevate Your YouTube Presence Without Breaking Trust</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-mac-centric-review-the-complete-guide-to-screenflow-v4/"><u>[Updated] Mac-Centric Review  The Complete Guide to ScreenFlow V4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-a-lost-samsung-galaxy-m14-4g-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track a Lost Samsung Galaxy M14 4G for Free? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-apple-iphone-15-plus-to-mac-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Mirror Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Mac? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-sj7-takes-action-filming-to-the-next-level-review-of-its-star-4k-cam/"><u>2024 Approved  SJ7 Takes Action Filming to the Next Level  Review of Its Star 4K Cam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-samsung-galaxy-s23-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Track a Lost Samsung Galaxy S23 for Free? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-tailored-gaming-journey-disabling-crossplay-for-solo-apex-players-for-2024/"><u>[New] Tailored Gaming Journey - Disabling Crossplay for Solo Apex Players for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-top-8-real-life-strategies-to-increase-youtube-reach/"><u>[New] Top 8 Real-Life Strategies to Increase YouTube Reach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-simplified-methods-for-saving-screen-share-talks/"><u>[New] Simplified Methods for Saving Screen-Share Talks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-use-google-assistant-on-your-lock-screen-of-realme-narzo-60x-5g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Use Google Assistant on Your Lock Screen Of Realme Narzo 60x 5G Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-seamlessly-turning-tiktok-videos-into-gifs-with-best-tools/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Seamlessly Turning TikTok Videos Into GIFs with Best Tools</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It brings to your screen tones of perks for better viewing. However, the service isn’t still widely known, and most people are on the verge of understanding what is entailed in the subscription. Most YouTube premium subscribers attest that the service is of value and are even relieved of the constant ads in the Free version. Dive into the article for more insights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-premium-subscription-1.png"                      alt="youtube premium subscriber"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is YouTube Premium?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-YouTube-Premium"><a href="#What-is-YouTube-Premium" class="headerlink" title="What is YouTube Premium?"></a>What is YouTube Premium?</h2><p>This streaming service was initially launched in 2014 and was later rebranded in 2018 as YouTube Premium. It includes YouTube music and other features that Google added to it. You can download content, perform background playback and even get access to YouTube original content. Note that this came at a cost as its price was raised. But what remains is that you get value for your money.</p><h4 id="1-What-service-is-included-in-the-Premium-subscription"><a href="#1-What-service-is-included-in-the-Premium-subscription" class="headerlink" title="1. What service is included in the Premium subscription?"></a>1. What service is included in the Premium subscription?</h4><p>The Premium subscription is an after-sought service that includes these services.</p><p>Background play: It allows one to play your videos in the background, enabling you to use the app as a music player.</p><p>Offline playback: Easily view your videos on your phone or tablet. It means you can download a video or music and play them while not on the internet.</p><p>Ad-free videos: Say goodbye to popular ads with YouTube Free subscription. You already catered for your freedom in the subscription.</p><p>YouTube Music Premium: YouTube music is available for free even though you won’t download it for offline playback on this tier.</p><p>Flip between apps swiftly: Your videos will continue playing even if you switch to another app. You can flip apps on your device, like check emails, read Twitter, scroll to texts and still play your videos.</p><h4 id="2-The-price-of-a-YouTube-Premium-subscription"><a href="#2-The-price-of-a-YouTube-Premium-subscription" class="headerlink" title="2. The price of a YouTube Premium subscription"></a>2. The price of a YouTube Premium subscription</h4><p>YouTube Premium isn’t different from other services. Like most streaming services, you get family and student plans. YouTube Premium costs your $6.99 monthly subscription for students’ plans. You, however, need to verify that you are a student. A family plan comes at $17.99 per month, where you can add up to five members. Single YouTube Premium will cost you $11.99 a month</p><h4 id="3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan"><a href="#3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan" class="headerlink" title="3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?"></a>3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?</h4><p>No. YouTube Premium does not provide an annual plan. You can only pay your subscription per month.</p><h4 id="4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium"><a href="#4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium" class="headerlink" title="4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium"></a>4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium</h4><p>Even though they sound similar, YouTube TV and YouTube Premium are different in many aspects. While YouTube Premium is a paid subscription, YouTube TV is a live streaming service. Let’s explore more differences.</p><h5 id="What-is-included"><a href="#What-is-included" class="headerlink" title="What is included"></a>What is included</h5><p>If you subscribe to YouTube Premium, then you unlock other streaming features. These include watching YouTube without ads on its apps, managing offline viewing, playing your videos in the background, and getting YouTube Music, among others.</p><p>You can watch various channels over the internet with YouTube TV, live. It offers you close to 90 channels cutting across lifestyle, news, entertainment, sports, etc. Likewise, you can stream live broadcasts from top networks like NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. It will also splash your screen with news channels from BBC America, CNN, FOX News, etc.</p><h5 id="Cost"><a href="#Cost" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h5><p>When it comes to pricing, YouTube Premium costs $11.00 per month with a free, one-month trial for new subscribers. It also has different plans for students and families. On the other hand, YouTube TV starts at $64.99 per month. However, first-time subscribers can get a free offer of up to one week at no cost. This rate may seem high, but it is competitive with other live TV streaming services.</p><h5 id="Accessibility"><a href="#Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h5><p>YouTube TV is readily available on the web, mobile platforms, and media streaming devices like Fire TV and Chromecast. You can also download the YouTube TV app to enjoy it on players like game consoles and PlayStations. For YouTube Premium, you’ll easily access it by subscription.</p><p>However, there are areas where both YouTube TV and YouTube Premium overlap. Both will let you watch YouTube Originals.</p><p>You will also enjoy your videos without adverts interruption. Additionally, it would be best to have an internet connection to stream your videos before downloading. And after downloading and saving your files, you can stream them offline on YouTube Premium.</p><p>So, which is better?</p><p>YouTube Premium subscribers think it’s the better choice. For one, if you like entertainment from services like Hulu, Netflix, Disney, and much more, then YouTube Premium has you covered than YouTube TV.</p><h5 id="Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries"><a href="#Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?"></a>Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?</h5><p>● YouTube Premium is not available in some countries. The likely reason is that those countries’ laws prevent it from being offered.</p><p>● But worry less, you can still access YouTube Premium even if it’s not available in your country. You can switch to an alternative county and stream videos.</p><ul><li>Make a quick switch by first clicking the “Country” button on the bottom of the YouTube homepage. Here, you’ll view various available countries where YouTube Premium is accessible.</li><li>Then click any country of choice to switch to. It will give you that country’s YouTube version.</li><li>You can also change your language if it presents a foreign language video and description. Just click on the “Language” button on the page.</li><li>Finally, access and play any YouTube premium video virtually from the country you switched to.</li></ul><h2 id="Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to"><a href="#Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to" class="headerlink" title="Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?"></a>Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</h2><p>Even with the lack of YouTube Premium annual subscription, it still beats all odds to subscribe to this streaming service.</p><h4 id="1-Offline-playback"><a href="#1-Offline-playback" class="headerlink" title="1) Offline playback"></a>1) Offline playback</h4><p>Office playback is one reason why YouTube lovers opt for the Premium subscription.

A family plan comes at $17.99 per month, where you can add up to five members. Single YouTube Premium will cost you $11.99 a month</p><h4 id="3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan-3"><a href="#3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?"></a>3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?</h4><p>No. YouTube Premium does not provide an annual plan. You can only pay your subscription per month.</p><h4 id="4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium-3"><a href="#4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium-3" class="headerlink" title="4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium"></a>4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium</h4><p>Even though they sound similar, YouTube TV and YouTube Premium are different in many aspects. While YouTube Premium is a paid subscription, YouTube TV is a live streaming service. Let’s explore more differences.</p><h5 id="What-is-included-3"><a href="#What-is-included-3" class="headerlink" title="What is included"></a>What is included</h5><p>If you subscribe to YouTube Premium, then you unlock other streaming features. These include watching YouTube without ads on its apps, managing offline viewing, playing your videos in the background, and getting YouTube Music, among others.</p><p>You can watch various channels over the internet with YouTube TV, live. It offers you close to 90 channels cutting across lifestyle, news, entertainment, sports, etc. Likewise, you can stream live broadcasts from top networks like NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. It will also splash your screen with news channels from BBC America, CNN, FOX News, etc.</p><h5 id="Cost-3"><a href="#Cost-3" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h5><p>When it comes to pricing, YouTube Premium costs $11.00 per month with a free, one-month trial for new subscribers. It also has different plans for students and families. On the other hand, YouTube TV starts at $64.99 per month. However, first-time subscribers can get a free offer of up to one week at no cost. This rate may seem high, but it is competitive with other live TV streaming services.</p><h5 id="Accessibility-3"><a href="#Accessibility-3" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h5><p>YouTube TV is readily available on the web, mobile platforms, and media streaming devices like Fire TV and Chromecast. You can also download the YouTube TV app to enjoy it on players like game consoles and PlayStations. For YouTube Premium, you’ll easily access it by subscription.</p><p>However, there are areas where both YouTube TV and YouTube Premium overlap. Both will let you watch YouTube Originals.</p><p>You will also enjoy your videos without adverts interruption. Additionally, it would be best to have an internet connection to stream your videos before downloading. And after downloading and saving your files, you can stream them offline on YouTube Premium.</p><p>So, which is better?</p><p>YouTube Premium subscribers think it’s the better choice. For one, if you like entertainment from services like Hulu, Netflix, Disney, and much more, then YouTube Premium has you covered than YouTube TV.</p><h5 id="Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries-3"><a href="#Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries-3" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?"></a>Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?</h5><p>● YouTube Premium is not available in some countries. The likely reason is that those countries’ laws prevent it from being offered.</p><p>● But worry less, you can still access YouTube Premium even if it’s not available in your country. You can switch to an alternative county and stream videos.</p><ul><li>Make a quick switch by first clicking the “Country” button on the bottom of the YouTube homepage. Here, you’ll view various available countries where YouTube Premium is accessible.</li><li>Then click any country of choice to switch to. It will give you that country’s YouTube version.</li><li>You can also change your language if it presents a foreign language video and description. Just click on the “Language” button on the page.</li><li>Finally, access and play any YouTube premium video virtually from the country you switched to.</li></ul><h2 id="Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to-3"><a href="#Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to-3" class="headerlink" title="Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?"></a>Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</h2><p>Even with the lack of YouTube Premium annual subscription, it still beats all odds to subscribe to this streaming service.</p><h4 id="1-Offline-playback-3"><a href="#1-Offline-playback-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Offline playback"></a>1) Offline playback</h4><p>Office playback is one reason why YouTube lovers opt for the Premium subscription. Saving your videos for offline listening gives you more advantages than needing to be online to stream your videos. You can do it by simply checking for the “Download” icon below the video you wish to save on your device for later watching. You are then free to stream your files at any time, on the go!</p><h4 id="2-Free-of-ads-at-last-3"><a href="#2-Free-of-ads-at-last-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Free of ads at last"></a>2) Free of ads at last</h4><p>YouTube streaming is much better without ever interacting with adverts. There are no pop-ups with the Premium version, letting you enjoy every bit of your video streaming. Again, such interruptions aren’t healthy for a tutorial session. Without ads, you can fully concentrate on video playing, letting you get quality value for your time.</p><h4 id="3-Get-original-content-3"><a href="#3-Get-original-content-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Get original content"></a>3) Get original content</h4><p>By fact, it is clear that this platform lets you interact with high-end artists who dwell on giving original content to their viewers. You’ll get a perfect chance to subscribe to artists who offer content, i.e., exclusive to the paid tier.</p><h4 id="4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free-3"><a href="#4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free-3" class="headerlink" title="4) Included Google Play Music for free"></a>4) Included Google Play Music for free</h4><p>It’s a double party for YouTube Premium subscribers. You have the advantage of getting Google Play Music when you subscribe to YouTube Music Premium. More so, the Google Play library gives you tones of music from their library. Combined with YouTube Premium offers, you won’t have any reason not to feel entertained from any genre of choice.</p><h4 id="Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way-3"><a href="#Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way-3" class="headerlink" title="Some improvements will go a long way"></a>Some improvements will go a long way</h4><p>Despite all the reasons to subscribe to YouTube Premium, it still needs a minor improvement to perfection.</p><ul><li>The YouTube Premium service’s availability is limited compared to the initial YouTube version. Therefore, some countries prohibit its usage and are only accessible in about 70 countries. Hopefully, it will be available worldwide so that no user is limited.</li><li>YouTube Premium subscription does not give any discounts on any of the subscriptions. And being that it has no yearly subscriptions, the amount remains the same whether you opt for one month or pay it times 12 for the year. There should be some considerations for offers, primarily when you cover the one-year payments.</li><li>Some users feel the price is higher than other streaming services. However, YouTube claims to offer free Google Play music. Perhaps this is the reason for the slight rise.</li><li>This streaming service lacks some extras like rentals and charged station subscriptions. Other features like “lyrics” to the songs have also not been catered for. Likewise, some extra information like the title or genre of the video you watch is not included. These small extras could go a long way if they were to be added.</li><li>YouTube Premium also seems to pay attention to celebrities other than YouTubers. Most originals are not exclusive to Premium subscribers, while you can watch them with ads on a free account.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Amidst the many YouTube subscriptions, YouTube Premium has come a long way. Additionally, it hasn’t covered all the countries just yet. However, it has eliminated the presence of annoying ads that are prominent with the free YouTube service. More so, you get free access to Google Play Music, among other added values. Despite those, the app still needs some improvements in its services to incorporate YouTube Premium subscribers in its walk fully.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Pre-Recorded-Yoga-on-YouTube"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Pre-Recorded-Yoga-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide to Pre-Recorded Yoga on YouTube"></a>The Ultimate Guide to Pre-Recorded Yoga on YouTube</h2><h5 id="Versatile-YouTube-Video-Editor-Filmora"><a href="#Versatile-YouTube-Video-Editor-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Versatile YouTube Video Editor - Filmora"></a>Versatile YouTube Video Editor - Filmora</h5><p>An easy yet powerful editor</p><p>Numerous effects to choose from</p><p>Detailed tutorials provided by official channel</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>10 Best Yoga YouTube Channels to Follow in 2024- Keep Fit</p><p>YouTube channels have now become a great medium to help people in their real-life activities.

You need to appeal to both YouTube viewers and those who consume content in the vertical orientation. The Filmora Auto Reframe feature allows you to automatically resize your videos with no editing skills needed. To use this feature:</p><h5 id="Step-1Start-the-Auto-Reframe-Feature"><a href="#Step-1Start-the-Auto-Reframe-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start the Auto Reframe Feature"></a>Step 1Start the Auto Reframe Feature</h5><p>One of the ways is by clicking on the Auto Reframe option when you launch Filmora.

However, building a YouTube Channel from 0 views to meet the eligibility status can be difficult. That’s why buying a monetized YouTube channel is a great place to start. You will only need to focus on creating highly engaging content to continue earning and growing your channel. To ensure that the content you create is of high quality, we recommend using Wondershare Filmora.

In our guide, you will find an answer to this, along with related queries like how YouTube highlighted comment works, the removal process, its benefits, and more.</p><p>If you own a YouTube channel or are starting one, even you can do this. Without further ado, let’s jump straight into the core of YouTube’s highlighted comments. We’ve categorized this article into a total of 8 parts for simple and better understanding.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Does Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Does Highlighted Comments Look Like on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Comment Highlighted?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Highlighted Comments URL?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment</a></li><li><a href="#part8">Part 8: Benefits of Highlighted Comments</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?"></a>Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</h2><p>Before you get on with highlighting your comments, you must understand what it means exactly. You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links. The 2 URLs lead you to the same video, but only one of them shows a highlighted comment.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Notice the name “lc” in the first URL- that stands for linked comment. YouTube might include this additional parameter. If a reply comment (HR) gets highlighted, the parent comment gets raised to the top.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?"></a>Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?</h2><p>YouTube has been working on improving the navigation of the comment section for videos, and highlighted comments are one of them. These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video. If you want to get the highlighted URL for the comment, simply click on the timestamp (e.g., 2 weeks ago) beside the commentator’s username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>On the other hand, for a YouTuber, getting access to the comment URL is relatively straightforward. The host will get a notification on his or her registered email-id when a viewer publishes a comment on their posted video. You will find the link to the highlighted comment in the notification</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Replying to “highlighted comments” on your YouTube channel is pretty easy since this feature was developed, keeping the user’s convenience in mind. If you want to follow up or reply to such comments, you can do so from your email or YouTube Dashboard.</p><p>If you click the notification bell icon, whenever a viewer drops a new comment on one of your videos, YouTube will send you a notification via email. On opening the email, you will find a clickable “Reply” option. Or else, if you follow the comment section in the YouTube Dashboard, you can directly view or reply to highlighted comments from here as well.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why a highlighted comment always shows at the top of the comment list? Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it. The purpose is to remind you that you are here for that specific comment.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Can you, as a video maker, remove highlighted comments on YouTube? The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously). Doing this will ensure that you no longer see any highlighted comments. However, at the same time, this will restrict you from interacting in any way with that video, let alone leaving a comment.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment"><a href="#Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?"></a>Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?</h2><p>Many frequently inquire on the internet about how they can improve the chances of getting their comment pinned, as highlighted on YouTube. The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial. That is especially true if you are looking for ways to optimize your channel.</p><p>YouTube is undeniably the second largest search engine on the web. Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel. If your comment gets highlighted, your YouTube channel can be one of them.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>YouTube can be an intimidating tool for marketing and more so for newcomers. Every YouTuber wishes that their channel performs better than the previous day. Even though the highlighted comment or highlighted reply feature doesn’t have any direct benefits, it can indeed help in optimizing your YouTube channel.</p><p>It can connect you with potential viewers and increase the number of people that visit your channel regularly.

This mirror allows you to look into your camera’s optical viewfinder and see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>The mirror inside a DSLR camera flips up out of the way when you open the shutter to allow light to reach the camera’s image sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >7 Best DSLR Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-Mirrorless-Camera-3"><a href="#What-is-a-Mirrorless-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a Mirrorless Camera?"></a>What is a Mirrorless Camera?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-camera.jpg"                      alt="Mirrorless Camera"                ></p><p>Mirrorless cameras are interchangeable lens cameras without a mirror inside the camera body. With nothing to reflect your image, you won’t find any optical viewfinder to look through to see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>Light passes through the lens of a mirrorless camera and lands directly onto the camera’s sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best Mirrorless Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison-3"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison-3" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison</h2><h4 id="Size-and-Weight-3"><a href="#Size-and-Weight-3" class="headerlink" title="Size and Weight"></a>Size and Weight</h4><p>DSLR cameras are larger and heavier than mirrorless cameras because there are more parts that go into their camera bodies. DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.</p><p>If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="Previewing-Images-3"><a href="#Previewing-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Previewing Images"></a>Previewing Images</h4><p>When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up. No matter how bright or dark your scene actually is, through the optical viewfinder, you’ll be able to clearly see what your camera sees with the power of your eye.</p><p>Mirrorless cameras, on the other hand, display on your camera’s screen or electronic viewfinder a digital preview of what your camera is looking at. You will notice a lag, especially in low light, between actions that are taking place in front of the camera and the same actions being displayed in your live preview.</p><h4 id="Lenses-and-Accessories-3"><a href="#Lenses-and-Accessories-3" class="headerlink" title="Lenses and Accessories"></a>Lenses and Accessories</h4><p>Having been around much longer, there are plenty more options for lenses and accessories when it comes to shooting with DSLR cameras. You can choose from all kinds of different quality levels and price ranges.</p><h4 id="Video-Resolution-3"><a href="#Video-Resolution-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Resolution"></a>Video Resolution</h4><p>4K video recording is more readily available in mirrorless cameras than DSLR cameras. At a much more affordable budget, you can get your hands on a 4K mirrorless camera. If you want to shoot 4K video on a DSLR camera, though, you will have to pay for some of the most expensive DSLR cameras on the market.</p><h4 id="Image-Stabilization-3"><a href="#Image-Stabilization-3" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization"></a>Image Stabilization</h4><p>Up until quite recently, you needed to get the right lens with built-in optical image stabilization if you wanted to shoot stabilized photos and videos with an interchangeable lens camera. Image stabilization had not been readily available in the bodies of these cameras.</p><p>In recent years, however, mirrorless cameras have been much more active in their development of camera bodies equipped with shifting image sensors. Your shots can be even more stabilized when the optical image stabilization of your lens is combined with your camera’s in-body sensor-shift image stabilization.</p><h4 id="Battery-Life-3"><a href="#Battery-Life-3" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p>When it comes to shooting video, DSLR cameras and mirrorless cameras consume about the same amount of power. It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video-3"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?</h2><p>In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go. In such a short time, mirrorless cameras have made huge leaps in their capabilities. It won’t be long before the ultimate vlogging camera comes out on the mirrorless market.</p><p>In the end, if you need to edit videos futhermore, try Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It is to see from these statistics why every video aspiring YouTubers post on their channels has to be perfect in every way in order to reach a wide audience. Fortunately, trimming a video even after you’ve uploaded it to YouTube is a quick and easy process, and in this article, we are going to show you a few different methods you can use to trim the videos you upload to YouTube. So, let’s get started.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Trimming a Video Before Posting On YouTube with Filmora Video Editor [4 Ways]</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="How-to-Trim-a-Video-After-You-Upload-it-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#How-to-Trim-a-Video-After-You-Upload-it-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?"></a>How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?</h2><p>The <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> is no longer in beta phase, which means that the feature is here to stay. This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.</p><p>Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your <strong>profile picture</strong> and select the <strong>YouTube Studio (Beta)</strong> option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like <strong>Analytics, Dashboard or Videos</strong>, so just click on the <strong>Videos</strong> option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Editor</strong> option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-editor-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube videos after uploading"                ></p><p>Click on the <strong>Trim button</strong> to start trimming the video and drag the <strong>blue bars</strong> located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video you’d like to remove. Preview the changes and confirm what you’ve made by clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button located in the upper right corner of the screen and the new shortened version of the video will become available within a couple of hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-save-video-trimming-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio - Trim YouTube videos after uploading"                ></p><p>In this way, you don’t need to take down the original video, edit it and re-upload.

Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the <strong>Media tab</strong>, and you can just <strong>drag and drop</strong> it to a video track on the timeline.</p><p>All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag <strong>one of its ends to the left or to the right</strong>. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display <strong>the remaining footage</strong> while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the <strong>Import with Instant Cutter Tool option</strong> from the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and wait for the <strong>Filmora Instant Cutter</strong> window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>Trim tab</strong> is selected and then click on the <strong>Open File button</strong> to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use <strong>the trimming sliders</strong> to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the <strong>In and Out points</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Set In Point or Set Out Point icons</strong>. Click on the <strong>Export button</strong> to save the new version of the video clip and <strong>click OK</strong> to complete the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instant-cutter-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Instant Cutter Tool"                ></p><h2 id="Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos"></a>Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</h2><p>In case you’re looking for a tool that lets you save extracts of scenes from YouTube to your computer free of charge <a class="link"   href="https://ytcutter.com/" >YT Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be one of your best options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yt-cutter-youtube-trimmer.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos online"                ></p><p>This online video editing platform is remarkably easy to use since you just have to <strong>copy</strong> <strong>the link to the YouTube video</strong> you’d like to trim into <strong>YT Cutter’s URL box</strong> and then select how long the new video should be.

This open-source audiovisual media file format was developed as a result of Google’s initiative and it is currently available under a BSD-style license.</p><p>WebM can be used free of charge in HTLM 5 video and audio elements, while its wrapper format is based on a Matroska profile. This file format is designed primarily for use on the web, since traditional video file formats may not play smoothly on all playback devices.</p><p>The low computational demands of WebM files ensure that a video saved in this format can be played even on playback devices that have limited processing capabilities. Moreover, WebM is perfectly suited for streaming purposes, since it maintains high picture quality while reducing the size of the video that is being broadcasted.</p><h2 id="Part-4-The-Advantages-of-Converting-YouTube-Videos-to-WebM-File-Format"><a href="#Part-4-The-Advantages-of-Converting-YouTube-Videos-to-WebM-File-Format" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Advantages of Converting YouTube Videos to WebM File Format"></a>Part 4: The Advantages of Converting YouTube Videos to WebM File Format</h2><p>The demand for video content has never been larger, as Internet users prefer this type of content to all other types of content that are available online. Converting a YouTube video to WebM will make it easier to embed it on a website or view on devices that don’t have a lot of computational power.</p><p>Optimizing all video content you post online for the devices from which they are going to be viewed will increase their reach. MP4 video files can sometimes be too large to post on social media, while WebM files maintain the same image quality at significantly lower file sizes.</p><p>WebM video files are created for online use and they are compatible with nearly all web browsers for PC computers which makes them a great option for anyone who wants to create video content on a constant basis. However, finding a media player for Windows OS that supports this video file format can prove to be a challenging task.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Converting a YouTube video to a WebM file format doesn’t require a lot of time or effort, because most online platforms or apps for Mac and PC computers make this process automatic. Even so, the amount of available file conversion tools is the best way to determine if a platform you’re considering is the right choice for you.

What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium</h4><p>Even though they sound similar, YouTube TV and YouTube Premium are different in many aspects. While YouTube Premium is a paid subscription, YouTube TV is a live streaming service. Let’s explore more differences.</p><h5 id="What-is-included"><a href="#What-is-included" class="headerlink" title="What is included"></a>What is included</h5><p>If you subscribe to YouTube Premium, then you unlock other streaming features. These include watching YouTube without ads on its apps, managing offline viewing, playing your videos in the background, and getting YouTube Music, among others.</p><p>You can watch various channels over the internet with YouTube TV, live. It offers you close to 90 channels cutting across lifestyle, news, entertainment, sports, etc. Likewise, you can stream live broadcasts from top networks like NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. It will also splash your screen with news channels from BBC America, CNN, FOX News, etc.</p><h5 id="Cost"><a href="#Cost" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h5><p>When it comes to pricing, YouTube Premium costs $11.00 per month with a free, one-month trial for new subscribers. It also has different plans for students and families. On the other hand, YouTube TV starts at $64.99 per month. However, first-time subscribers can get a free offer of up to one week at no cost. This rate may seem high, but it is competitive with other live TV streaming services.</p><h5 id="Accessibility"><a href="#Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h5><p>YouTube TV is readily available on the web, mobile platforms, and media streaming devices like Fire TV and Chromecast. You can also download the YouTube TV app to enjoy it on players like game consoles and PlayStations. For YouTube Premium, you’ll easily access it by subscription.</p><p>However, there are areas where both YouTube TV and YouTube Premium overlap.

For one, if you like entertainment from services like Hulu, Netflix, Disney, and much more, then YouTube Premium has you covered than YouTube TV.</p><h5 id="Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries"><a href="#Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?"></a>Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?</h5><p>● YouTube Premium is not available in some countries. The likely reason is that those countries’ laws prevent it from being offered.</p><p>● But worry less, you can still access YouTube Premium even if it’s not available in your country. You can switch to an alternative county and stream videos.</p><ul><li>Make a quick switch by first clicking the “Country” button on the bottom of the YouTube homepage.

Saving your videos for offline listening gives you more advantages than needing to be online to stream your videos. You can do it by simply checking for the “Download” icon below the video you wish to save on your device for later watching. You are then free to stream your files at any time, on the go!</p><h4 id="2-Free-of-ads-at-last"><a href="#2-Free-of-ads-at-last" class="headerlink" title="2) Free of ads at last"></a>2) Free of ads at last</h4><p>YouTube streaming is much better without ever interacting with adverts.

You have the advantage of getting Google Play Music when you subscribe to YouTube Music Premium. More so, the Google Play library gives you tones of music from their library. Combined with YouTube Premium offers, you won’t have any reason not to feel entertained from any genre of choice.</p><h4 id="Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way"><a href="#Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way" class="headerlink" title="Some improvements will go a long way"></a>Some improvements will go a long way</h4><p>Despite all the reasons to subscribe to YouTube Premium, it still needs a minor improvement to perfection.</p><ul><li>The YouTube Premium service’s availability is limited compared to the initial YouTube version. Therefore, some countries prohibit its usage and are only accessible in about 70 countries. Hopefully, it will be available worldwide so that no user is limited.</li><li>YouTube Premium subscription does not give any discounts on any of the subscriptions. And being that it has no yearly subscriptions, the amount remains the same whether you opt for one month or pay it times 12 for the year. There should be some considerations for offers, primarily when you cover the one-year payments.</li><li>Some users feel the price is higher than other streaming services. However, YouTube claims to offer free Google Play music. Perhaps this is the reason for the slight rise.</li><li>This streaming service lacks some extras like rentals and charged station subscriptions. Other features like “lyrics” to the songs have also not been catered for. Likewise, some extra information like the title or genre of the video you watch is not included. These small extras could go a long way if they were to be added.</li><li>YouTube Premium also seems to pay attention to celebrities other than YouTubers. Most originals are not exclusive to Premium subscribers, while you can watch them with ads on a free account.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Amidst the many YouTube subscriptions, YouTube Premium has come a long way. Additionally, it hasn’t covered all the countries just yet. However, it has eliminated the presence of annoying ads that are prominent with the free YouTube service. More so, you get free access to Google Play Music, among other added values. Despite those, the app still needs some improvements in its services to incorporate YouTube Premium subscribers in its walk fully.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>It was formerly known as YouTube Red three years ago when it first launched.

The first 15 seconds of a video is when viewers are most likely to decide to click on one of the recommended videos, or go back to their search results and choose something else. The odds of them leaving within these first 15 seconds are greater if you do not get right to the main point of your video. That is why long intro sequences are bad for your watch time.</p><p>Whether it is better to put your intro at the very beginning of your video, or after you introduce your topic, will depend on your viewers. You may want to try it both ways and then look at your retention report (found in your YouTube Creator Studio under Analytics) to see which works best for you.</p><h4 id="Top-Intro-Sites"><a href="#Top-Intro-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Top Intro Sites"></a>Top Intro Sites</h4><p>There are a few different sites where you can download animated intros, customized to include your username or logo.

There are a lot of great animated intros available for under $5, or even for free.</p><p><strong>IntroMaker.net</strong></p><p>This is another site with really professional looking intros for $5. They only have two free options, though.</p><h4 id="Creating-an-Intro-in-Filmora"><a href="#Creating-an-Intro-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Creating an Intro in Filmora"></a>Creating an Intro in Filmora</h4><p>You can create a simple intro card in <strong>Filmora</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><ol><li>Choose your background. You may want to use a short clip as your intro, or you may just want a colored background.</li><li>Drag your clip or background into the video track of your timeline and trim it down to five seconds.</li><li>If you have a logo, import it into Filmora and drag it into your picture-in-picture track.</li><li>With your logo selected, click on the Green Screen icon. In the pop-up, select the background of your logo to make it transparent. For this to work your logo cannot be the same color as its background.</li><li>Click on the editing icon with your logo selected and choose an animation.</li><li>Go to the Text&#x2F;Titles menu and choose an animated title that suits your channel. Drag it into your text track and edit it to include your name.</li><li>The last piece of your intro is sound. You can choose a song from Filmora’s library and cut it down to five seconds, or import your sound effect.</li><li>Export your video and save it for use in all of your other videos.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-End-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-End-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: End Cards"></a>Part 2: End Cards</h2><p>When your video ends, YouTube will recommend a selection of videos users may want to watch next. Often, these recommendations will not include more of your videos.</p><p>To keep viewers on your channel, you can create your End Card which recommends other content you have created.</p><h4 id="Elements-of-an-End-Card"><a href="#Elements-of-an-End-Card" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an End Card"></a>Elements of an End Card</h4><p>An end card includes clips from two or three of your videos, muted, and shrunk down to thumbnail-size. Using spotlight annotations you can make these thumbnails click-able.</p><p>It is also important that your end card includes multiple calls to action. A call to action is meant to spur a viewer to some kind of action. Writing ‘Check out this video’ above one of your thumbnails is a call to action.</p><p>You should also have a subscribe link somewhere in your end card, ideally a very noticeable button with a proven call to action like ‘Subscribe Now!’.</p><p>Some creators will leave their end cards at that and play music overtop, but it can be even more effective to include a voiceover where you ask viewers to subscribe and watch your other videos.</p><h4 id="How-To-Make-an-End-Card"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-End-Card" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an End Card"></a>How To Make an End Card</h4><ol><li>Choose a static background. You may want to download an end card template or create one in a drawing program. If you do, make sure to include calls to action like ‘Watch more!’ and ‘Subscribe’.</li><li>Drag your background into your timeline at the end of your video.</li><li>Import two or three of your previous videos and drag them into your picture in picture tracks.

Everyone knows that big YouTubers get paid through the ads that play ahead of their videos. More and more YouTubers keep showing how much money they are making from YouTube via the lifestyles they lead. It begs the question - how much money do YouTubers make?</p><p>One of the main questions is “how many views do you need to start making money on YouTube?” The answer to this question is complicated. You need 4,000 hours of annual viewing time and 1,000 subscribers on your channel to sign up for monetization, but just being able to monetize your videos doesn’t mean you’re going to make money.</p><p>The reason is that YouTubers are not paid per view, they are paid per ad impression.</p><ul><li><a href="#types">Types of YouTube Ads - What is an Ad Impression?</a></li><li><a href="#cpi">CPI Rates Explained</a></li><li><a href="#bigyoutubers">How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?</a></li><li><a href="#milestone">Why No Longer 10,000 Views?</a></li></ul><p>Want a fast answer about how much money a YouTuber makes? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out these calculators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Types-of-YouTube-Ads-–-What-is-an-Ad-Impression"><a href="#Types-of-YouTube-Ads-–-What-is-an-Ad-Impression" class="headerlink" title="Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?"></a>Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?</h2><p>If you ask YouTubers about how much they make per thousand views, you’ll probably get a different answer depending on the person on who you ask. You may have already heard things like $5 per thousand views or $1,000 per 1 million views, but neither of these is for sure.</p><p>Google’s AdSense service, through which YouTubers make money, pays YouTubers for ad impressions. For most types of ads – including short pre-roll ads, the ads which appear at the bottoms of videos while they play, and the ads which appear as banners to the side of YouTube’s player – an ad impression means someone clicking on the ad and choosing to visit the advertiser’s site. One exception is skippable video ads, for which an impression is created when a viewer watches the ad for 30 seconds.</p><p>YouTubers do not make money on the views of their videos, because not all viewers click on ads. Many viewers bypass ads completely using ad-blockers. The amount of money YouTubers earn from a single ad impression is called their CPI or “cost per impression.”</p><h2 id="CPI-Rates-Explained"><a href="#CPI-Rates-Explained" class="headerlink" title="CPI Rates Explained"></a>CPI Rates Explained</h2><p>YouTube advertising is currently managed inside the AdSense platform. In case you’re not familiar with AdSense, you can have 2 different kinds of ads - the cost per click (CPC) or the cost per view (CPV).</p><h4 id="Cost-Per-Click-ads"><a href="#Cost-Per-Click-ads" class="headerlink" title="Cost Per Click ads"></a>Cost Per Click ads</h4><p>The advertiser pays based on how many clicks he was able to get with that particular ad. These kinds of ads usually appear on the right side of your YouTube channel or they can also appear at the bottom of the screen, during the video.</p><h4 id="Cost-Per-View-ads"><a href="#Cost-Per-View-ads" class="headerlink" title="Cost Per View ads"></a>Cost Per View ads</h4><p>the advertiser will pay based on the views he had of the ad and not based on the clicks he was able to generate. One of the things that many people aren’t aware of is the fact that the viewer needs to spend at least 30 seconds watching the ad or half the ad, whichever comes first. This means that a single viewer can continue clicking on the ad multiple times that the advertiser won’t be billed for all those clicks because he is only paying for views.</p><h4 id="Never-Click-on-the-CPC-ads-of-Your-Own-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Never-Click-on-the-CPC-ads-of-Your-Own-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos"></a>Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos</h4><p>If any of your friends ever suggest that they are going to do so to help you out tell them not to. AdSense has a rate of ad-clicks that it considers normal and if you get significantly more clicks than that it will think you’re artificially pushing that number up by either clicking yourself or having someone do it for you. If this happens they will ban you from AdSense and, although there is an appeals process, it is unlikely you will ever get your account back and be able to monetize videos again.</p><p>How much you make from an ad on YouTube depends on your CPI, cost per impression. Simply put, this is the rate that YouTube will pay you for every 1,000 views or clicks of the ads that are attached to your videos. Even though it would be a lot simpler if YouTube had their current CPI rates available, they don’t. These rates vary depending on the ad, the types of videos you make, and how popular your channel is. It is actually against YouTube’s rules for YouTubers to share their personal CPI rates publicly.</p><p>Most people tend to assume that CPI rates are between $0.05 and $10. This huge difference is justified by YouTube by saying that they use a very complicated algorithm to determine your CPI rate. According to them, it includes evaluating factors like the ads, the type of audience who views your video, audience engagement, audience retention, and the price of the ads.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Do-Big-YouTubers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-Big-YouTubers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?"></a>How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?</h2><p>Many people are aspiring to make money as famous YouTubers, but it is not an easy task. You have a long way to go before you start making any money at all.</p><p>In general, it’s reasonable to expect to start earning some money when you get to 1 million subscribers. This is the point at which you can start treating YouTube as your job, but the truth is that you will still not be making amazing money. At 1 million subscribers you will only be starting to be seen as someone important in your industry. You won’t even necessarily be “YouTube famous” yet – there are a lot of channels with 1 million subs.</p><p>Even though most people think that YouTube channels with 1 million subscribers are already making a good amount of money and that they are already at the top, the truth is that they’ve just started climbing. They aren’t even near the top. Just to give you a better idea, there are more than 2,400 YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers.</p><p>According to Google, when an advertiser pays $100 to Google, Google pays $68 to the publisher (in this case, the publisher is a YouTube creator).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-much-do-youtubers-make.png"                      alt="How Much Do YouTuber Makes"                ></p><p><em>This graphic won’t apply to every situation because every situation is unique. It’s just an example using assumed numbers.</em></p><h4 id="How-much-money-for-1-000-YouTube-views"><a href="#How-much-money-for-1-000-YouTube-views" class="headerlink" title="How much money for 1,000 YouTube views?"></a>How much money for 1,000 YouTube views?</h4><p>15% of 1,000 is 150</p><p>150x CPI ($0.18) &#x3D; $27*</p><p>51% of $27 &#x3D; $13</p><p>Using these rates, 1000 views are worth $13!</p><p>*CPI vary</p><p>Assuming that the average rate is about $0.18 per impression, you still need to factor in that most people don’t click on ads or watch skippable video ads for 30 seconds. Only about 15% of viewers tend to watch the complete ad (or, at least half of it). So, considering that you have 1,000 views on your video, only 150 viewers watched your complete ad. So, at $0.18 per view, Google will charge $27 to the advertiser and the YouTube channel will get 51% of that, meaning the creator will earn $13 per 1,000 views.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to know how much YouTube pays for 1 million views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</p><p>It will take you a long time to start earning enough money to support yourself through AdSense. That’s why AdSense isn’t the primary way that huge YouTube stars make money. In addition to AdSense revenue you can (and should) also consider other opportunities such as product placement, endorsements, and brand sponsorships. Many YouTubers also make some money from selling their merchandise.</p><p>Some YouTubers earn millions of dollars every year. Although the exact numbers have never been disclosed, many different websites have made educated guesses.</p><p>Forbes publishes an annual list of the highest-paid YouTubers, which includes revenue from things like book deals and makeup lines. It is useful to look at this list gain have some perspective about how big YouTubers make their money, and how big they had to get to make it.</p><p>As of 2017, YouTube gamer Daniel Middleton (DanTDM) is the highest-paid YouTuber earning 16 million dollars. He is followed by gamer Evan Fong (Vanoss Gaming) with $15.5 million, Dude Perfect with $14 million, and Mark Fischbach (Markiplier) and Logan Paul with $12.5 million. However, as we already mentioned, even though a substantial part of the income of these YouTube stars comes from YouTube&#x2F;AdSense, the bulk of it comes from things like merchandise and sponsorships.</p><p>Instead of relying on YouTube to pay them, YouTubers need to seek out other ways of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >leveraging the YouTube platform to earn money <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>We all agree that being a YouTube star isn’t an easy path. However, if you honestly love what you do, then you will be willing to put effort into making great videos regularly. Part of that is also being willing to take the time to promote them and yourself, as well as putting time and effort into forging a good relationship with your audience.</p><h2 id="Why-No-Longer-10-000-Views"><a href="#Why-No-Longer-10-000-Views" class="headerlink" title="Why No Longer 10,000 Views?"></a>Why No Longer 10,000 Views?</h2><p>YouTube used to let anybody monetize their videos, but that has now changed. Then for a while, you’ll qualify for monetization after reaching 10,000-lifetime views on your channel. But as of 2018, the rules to YouTube monetization has gotten more challenging.</p><p>To monetize you must have:</p><p>- 4,000 of annual watch time</p><p>- 1,000 subscribers</p><p>The reason for this is that YouTube was having trouble with channels that were trying to monetize stolen or inappropriate content, besides, YouTubers are gaming the system by using automated programs to gain more views. By making creators get more watch time and subscribers before they apply for monetization, YouTube has been able to create a review process in which they can prove that the channel has a legitimate audience and stop content thieves and criminals from making money. Naturally, this new rule also makes it very difficult for new YouTubers to make money.</p><p><em>Are you finding it difficult to earn money on YouTube?
