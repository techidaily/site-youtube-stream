It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective-1"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><h3 id="Content-Relevance-1"><a href="#Content-Relevance-1" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal-1"><a href="#Audience-Appeal-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility-1"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility-1" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding-1"><a href="#Personal-Branding-1" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><h3 id="Editing-1"><a href="#Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a <strong>green screen background for YouTube videos</strong>.</p><h2 id="5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas-1"><a href="#5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas"></a><strong>5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas</strong></h2><p>It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><ul><li>Snowy Landscape</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-1.png"                      alt="snowy landscape youtube background"                ></p><ul><li>Festive Holiday Decor</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-2.png"                      alt="festive holiday decor image"                ></p><ul><li>Cozy Indoor Settings</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-3.png"                      alt="cozy indoor winter background"                ></p><ul><li>Winter Cityscapes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-4.png"                      alt="winter cityscapes background"                ></p><ul><li>Animated Winter Scenes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-5.png"                      alt="animated winter scenes background"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds-1"><a href="#How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds"></a>How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds</h2><p>If you want to make your own winter backgrounds or simply edit the ones you have, the most effective way is to use a beginner-friendly video editing platform, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>This type of platform has all the necessary tools, templates, and presets for professionals to use but all of it is packed in a very easy-to-use interface that anyone can get the hang of.</p><p>Just follow these steps and you’ll have the perfect winter <strong>background for YouTube</strong> in no time.</p><h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Download and install the Filmora video editing tool.</p><h5 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Run the program and click on <strong>“</strong>New Project”.

Vintage also resembles love apart from videos and photos. All in all, it’s a positive and result-oriented thing to carry on in your videos. And this is what we want to mention in this post relating to the creation of vintage videos.</p><p>Here are some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >vintage-style video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to have a look at.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-to-Consider-When-Shooting-a-Vintage-Video"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Shooting-a-Vintage-Video" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?"></a>What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?</h2><p>Vintage videos are kind of old school vibes and must be shooting accordingly by keeping in mind the following points. These are a sort of expert tips given by photographers based on their practical experience. First of all, you have to understand that a video can be made vintage, but you can’t change the actual environment of shooting. Some editing always involves there in every project out there. Still, the tips given below will help you a lot in creating a retro look.</p><h4 id="Use-Vintage-Lenses"><a href="#Use-Vintage-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Use Vintage Lenses"></a>Use Vintage Lenses</h4><p>The very first helpful tip is to use a vintage lens. They allow chromatic aberration by distorting colors around the frame. Furthermore, you can find various kinds of lenses in terms of a vintage effect.</p><h4 id="Decrease-Contrast"><a href="#Decrease-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="Decrease Contrast"></a>Decrease Contrast</h4><p>Do the correct color grading by reducing the contrast a little bit. You must not level the retro videos in black or white or like-new videos. You can simply add a contrasting effect and then reduce it to have that vintage look.</p><h4 id="Keep-it-a-little-soft"><a href="#Keep-it-a-little-soft" class="headerlink" title="Keep it a little soft"></a>Keep it a little soft</h4><p>If you have ever noticed, the vintage videos are a little soft and look like degraded with time. It’s a result of decreased sharpness in the camera’s menu settings. You can even add a slight blur to the final video or simply use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >recognized software made for video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Brighten-up-the-black-levels"><a href="#Brighten-up-the-black-levels" class="headerlink" title="Brighten up the black levels"></a>Brighten up the black levels</h4><p>Lots of black points in the video are not ideal for a vintage effect. The suitable approach is to bring up black levels and make it dark gray instead of inky black. This look can be achieved either by levels effect or curves effect in your editing software.</p><h4 id="Reduce-Saturation-levels"><a href="#Reduce-Saturation-levels" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Saturation levels"></a>Reduce Saturation levels</h4><p>Bringing down the saturation levels is another tip to create a vintage effect. The old videos are also absent in bright colors. Don’t go too crazy about reduction as 20%-30% saturation level is more than enough.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?"></a>How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</h2><p>What you need to get started as both beginner and professional is Wondershare Filmora Video Editor.

We have added the three <strong>sample videos</strong> from the library of Wondershare Filmora itself. Adjust them in the timeline as per your requirements.</p><p>After doing all the essential editing functions, click on the <strong>Effects tab</strong> given at the upper-left corner. Simply type the word Old in the Search tab.</p><p>The Old Video filter will immediately appear in the list of filters. Tap the <strong>“+”</strong> icon in Old Video filter to add to the timeline. Drag its ends right or left to adjust the duration.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply White &amp; Black Filters</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-2.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>The second step is to apply the Black &amp; White filters. Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and explore five Black &amp; White filters available. Each of these filters is quite different and must be applied accordingly. Check the aesthetic of your video clip before any filter application to retro videos.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the Sun Kissed or Sepia Tone Rise Filters to the video clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>There are various other categories of filters you can apply, such as Retro, Sun Kissed, and Sepia Tone, etc. The features of Filmora also present several subcategories such as Faux Film or Shake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-4.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>On the other hand, the subcategory of Sepia Tone features Sun-Kissed &amp; Rise Filters to stimulate sepia-tinted texture and recreate the old visual style. The Sun Kissed filter presents brown and red colors to give that warm image atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Desaturate Video Clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-5.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Now, you need to desaturate the video clip with Ash &amp; Willow filters. We have typed Ash in the Search bar, and you can see the filter below. These filters are essential to desaturate the video with preset contrast, brightness, or exposure values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-6.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Then, we have combined the black &amp; white filter with an overlay of Film Reel Horizontal. It will help you sell the effect and make the video look more authentic. However, the only application of Black &amp; White or Ash &amp; Willow filters is not going to make any creative thing in terms of vintage videos. You have to mix overlays with features such as Random Dust or Film Reel Horizontal.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Apply Black &amp; White and Old Film Color Correction Presets to the video</p><p>You can also access the Advanced color correction Tab of Filmora from the Color button. It also features Preset and Adjusts Tabs to desaturate footage. The Preset presents a variety of options, including Black &amp; White and Old Film. You just need to right-click the particular preset and select the Apply option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-advance-color-correction.jpg"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><h2 id="Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out"></a>Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</h2><p>Following the helpful tips would assist you in creating awesome retro videos.</p><ul><li>You can use various vintage apps such as <strong>Retro VHS</strong>, <strong>RTRO Camera</strong>, <strong>8mm</strong>, <strong>Camcorder</strong>, <strong>VSCO</strong>, etc. Or, despite using these limited apps, you can directly use our preferred video editing software called <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.</li><li>If you use a specific vintage camera, keep it on low highlights and low contrasts. Use color grading, as we have discussed above. They help to provide the ultimate old-school effect.</li><li>Always keep low saturation settings for shooting vintage videos. Take control over Saturation, Hue, and <strong>Luminance</strong> of video.</li><li>Add overlays and respective filters to recreate a required vintage look. You must add things that dust, scratch, and grain the heck out from the video that you have created.</li><li>Lower the frame rate or FPS to create an excellent vintage look. You can make it to 18 or 14 FPS depending upon the aesthetic requirements.</li><li>Keep an eye on black and white filters you have used. It’s because more of a black and white can ruin the actual vintage experience.</li></ul><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>So, this is an ultimate tutorial on the creation of vintage videos.

People are more likely to do something if you give them a bit of a nudge, and that includes subscribing to your YouTube channel.</p><p>There are people who think that if people like their videos they’ll subscribe, so they shouldn’t bother people by asking. This is, simply put, wrong. When people are browsing YouTube their minds are on what video they want to watch next, not whether or not they want to subscribe – unless you remind them.</p><ol><li><a href="#cta">What is a ‘Call To Action’?</a></li><li><a href="#betterway">A More Effective Way of Asking for Subscribers</a>  <ol><li><a href="#hook">Step 1: How to Hook the Viewer</a>  </li><li><a href="#point">Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly</a>  </li><li><a href="#moment">Step 3: Create a Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience</a></li></ol></li></ol><h2 id="What-is-a-‘Call-To-Action’"><a href="#What-is-a-‘Call-To-Action’" class="headerlink" title="What is a ‘Call To Action’?"></a>What is a ‘Call To Action’?</h2><p>It has become the norm for YouTubers to ask viewers to subscribe in their sign-offs. A typical CTA (‘call to action’) goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Thanks for watching. If you liked this video, make sure to subscribe for more!”</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s great. At the end of a video is a good place to ask people to subscribe, but is it the best and only place you should be reminding them? If you take a peek at your analytics and you might find that most of your viewers aren’t watching to the ends of your videos (people have short attention spans).</p><h2 id="A-More-Effective-Way-of-Asking-For-Subscribers"><a href="#A-More-Effective-Way-of-Asking-For-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers"></a>A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers</h2><p>Collins Key is one YouTuber who has mastered asking for subscribers early on, and given that he has over 7 million subscribers himself I’d say it’s working out. Check out the technique in this video collab with Brooklyn and Bailey:</p><h4 id="Step-1-How-to-Hook-The-Viewer"><a href="#Step-1-How-to-Hook-The-Viewer" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer"></a>Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer</h4><p>As you can see, the video starts with a ‘flash forward’ to one of the twins saying the heater is on fire and then a reminder of what’s going to happen later – the heater catching fire – is written in the top left of the screen so it stays on the viewers’ mind. This is one way in which the viewer is immediately hooked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-by-hook.jpg"                      alt=" how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly"><a href="#Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly"></a>Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly</h4><p>Shortly after, while still in the first 30 seconds of the video, Collins gets right to the point and introduces the Twin Telepathy Challenge promised in the title of the video. The hook with the heater catching fire is effective, but it’s not essential. It happens to suit Collins’ style, and it happens to have happened. Getting to the main point of the video quickly – usually in the first 15 seconds, not the first 30 (it’s in the first 15 seconds that most viewers click away) – is vital. People click on videos for a reason, and if they don’t see a sign of that payoff quickly they’ll leave.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience"><a href="#Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience"></a>Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience</h4><p>It’s only after hooking the viewer in and reiterating the promise of the title that Collins asks viewers to subscribe. The really clever thing about how he asks is that he carves out time in the video for the viewer to comply with his request. He gives 5 seconds and does a countdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-in-perfect-moment.jpg"                      alt=" how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><p>Collins Key has been one of the fastest-growing channels on YouTube. He does not implement this strategy in every video, but it’s not a stretch to think it’s had something to do with his success. Instead of simply asking you to subscribe at the end of the video, he creates a part of the video early on – before people who don’t watch until the end will have clicked away – where you feel as if you’re ‘supposed to’ subscribe.</p><h3 id="Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p>Even with the above tricks, you may not get the subscribers as you wish unless you can make sure your videos and contents are of high quality. As YouTube is getting more and more popular and more YouTubers are competing for subscribers, you will need to polish your YouTube videos.</p><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software in YouTube video editing, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides lots of templates and effects with an intuitive interface, which saves much time.

Post YouTube Videos Consistently"></a>1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently</h2><p>In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html" >keep posting constantly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.</p><h2 id="2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video"><a href="#2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Provide Value in Each Video"></a>2. Provide Value in Each Video</h2><p>Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.</p><h2 id="3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’"><a href="#3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’" class="headerlink" title="3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’"></a>3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’</h2><p>Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >call to action <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.</p><p>One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >brand-new viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.</p><h2 id="4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community"><a href="#4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community" class="headerlink" title="4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community"></a>4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community</h2><p>YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html" >gain support for your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.</p><p>Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >appear in one of their videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.</p><h2 id="5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them"><a href="#5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them" class="headerlink" title="5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them"></a>5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them</h2><p>Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.</p><p>Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Find a Niche for Your Videos"></a>6. Find a Niche for Your Videos</h2><p>Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html" >niches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.</p><p>Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.</p><h2 id="7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand"><a href="#7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand" class="headerlink" title="7. Build a Strong Personal Brand"></a>7. Build a Strong Personal Brand</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html" >Building a brand on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html" >channel art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.</p><p>Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.</p><h2 id="8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art"><a href="#8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="8. Create Custom Channel Art"></a>8. Create Custom Channel Art</h2><p>To differentiate yourself from your competition you’re going to need to have <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html" >custom Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.</p><h2 id="9-Practice-Makes-Perfect"><a href="#9-Practice-Makes-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="9. Practice Makes Perfect"></a>9. Practice Makes Perfect</h2><p>In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.</p><p>Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you’re working with will<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html" >save you time when you’re actually polishing a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.</p><p>Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.</p><h2 id="10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video"><a href="#10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video" class="headerlink" title="10. Add a YouTube Intro Video"></a>10. Add a YouTube Intro Video</h2><p>A professional-looking intro clip (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn how to make one here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions"><a href="#11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="11. Use Video Effects and Transitions"></a>11. Use Video Effects and Transitions</h2><p>Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.</p><p>Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.</p><p>It can take some time to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html" >add these kinds of effects to your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.</p><h2 id="12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails"><a href="#12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails"></a>12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails</h2><p>A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html" >or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).</p><h2 id="13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags"><a href="#13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags" class="headerlink" title="13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags"></a>13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >Tags should include keywords&#x2F;search terms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.</p><p>Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords&#x2F;tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.</p><h2 id="14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time"><a href="#14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time"></a>14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it’s much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.</p><p>Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.</p><h2 id="15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media"><a href="#15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media"></a>15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media</h2><p>Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html" >the promotion that you do through social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="16-Interact-with-your-Viewers"><a href="#16-Interact-with-your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="16. Interact with your Viewers"></a>16. Interact with your Viewers</h2><p>Spending time <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-youtube-audience-283.html" >interacting with your viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> via comments and social media is important. Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&amp;A videos.</p><h2 id="17-Check-Out-the-Big-Channels-in-Your-Genre"><a href="#17-Check-Out-the-Big-Channels-in-Your-Genre" class="headerlink" title="17. Check Out the Big Channels in Your Genre"></a>17. Check Out the Big Channels in Your Genre</h2><p>Spending time <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/your-youtube-rivals---how-to-get-more-views-by-checking-out-the-competition-62.html" >examining your competition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is very important. By looking at the popular channels in your genre you can learn what kinds of videos are popular and what types of video titles and tags you should be using.</p><h2 id="18-Do-Collaboration-Videos"><a href="#18-Do-Collaboration-Videos" class="headerlink" title="18. Do Collaboration Videos"></a>18. Do Collaboration Videos</h2><p>When you <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >collaborate with other YouTube creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it leads to mutual success. You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It’s amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.</p><p>Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.</p><h2 id="19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video"><a href="#19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video" class="headerlink" title="19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video"></a>19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video</h2><p>The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO&#x2F;search engine optimization.</p><h2 id="20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable"><a href="#20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable" class="headerlink" title="20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable"></a>20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable</h2><p>In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.</p><p>For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="21-Make-your-Thumbnails-Consistent"><a href="#21-Make-your-Thumbnails-Consistent" class="headerlink" title="21. Make your Thumbnails Consistent"></a>21. Make your Thumbnails Consistent</h2><p>The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html" >create a familiar look <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them. If someone can instantly recognize your video thumbnails it will strengthen your brand and encourage repeat viewership.</p><h2 id="22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos"></a>22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos</h2><p>If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.</p><h2 id="23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views"><a href="#23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views" class="headerlink" title="23. Make Titles that Get Views"></a>23. Make Titles that Get Views</h2><p>Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.</p><h2 id="24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer"></a>24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer</h2><p>Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

We recommend <strong>Wondershare Fimora9</strong> video editor for beautiful editing features. It consists of lots of new functions, including advanced editing options as well. None of the recruitment videos is posted online without editing.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Include-a-CTA-Call-to-Action"><a href="#Include-a-CTA-Call-to-Action" class="headerlink" title="Include a CTA (Call to Action)"></a>Include a CTA (Call to Action)</h4><p>Don’t make a video like a lost opportunity.

This online video editor offers a number of video editing tools that let you polish your videos before posting them on social media.</p><p>Click on the Resize tool and simply <strong>copy and paste the URL</strong> of a YouTube into the appropriate bar and the platform will <strong>automatically import a video and display it on the screen</strong> once the content is finally fetched.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-crop-youtube-to-igtv.jpg"                      alt="Kapwing  Crop YouTube video to IGTV"                ></p><p>Pick the <strong>Story (Snap&#x2F;Insta) or IGTV 9:16 option</strong> and then proceed to <strong>choose the background color for your IGTV video, increase or decrease the zoom level or change the position of the video</strong>. Click on the <strong>Create button</strong> when ready and wait for Kapwing to process your video. <strong>All videos you create with the free version of this online video editor are going to be watermarked</strong> and you have to pay a six-dollar fee for each watermark-free video you edit with Kapwing or you can opt for a $20 monthly subscription fee that enables you to export an unlimited amount of videos without watermarks each month.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-convert-to-igtv.jpg"                      alt="Kapwing  Rotate YouTube video to IGTV"                ></p><p>A growing number of IGTV users choose to rotate their videos, instead of resizing them, so if you already have a YouTube video with a 16:9 aspect ratio you can just rotate it and get a video with a 9:16 aspect ratio. Click on the <strong>Rotate</strong>  option and then rotate it <strong>90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise</strong> and click on the <strong>Create button</strong>. If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > How to Convert MKV to MP4 without Losing Quality [Free Converters Provided] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro"></a>Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to <strong>set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. During the video editing process, you will have to <strong>resize all of the footage</strong> you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.</p><p>If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media.

This online video editor offers a number of video editing tools that let you polish your videos before posting them on social media.</p><p>Click on the Resize tool and simply <strong>copy and paste the URL</strong> of a YouTube into the appropriate bar and the platform will <strong>automatically import a video and display it on the screen</strong> once the content is finally fetched.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-crop-youtube-to-igtv.jpg"                      alt="Kapwing  Crop YouTube video to IGTV"                ></p><p>Pick the <strong>Story (Snap&#x2F;Insta) or IGTV 9:16 option</strong> and then proceed to <strong>choose the background color for your IGTV video, increase or decrease the zoom level or change the position of the video</strong>. Click on the <strong>Create button</strong> when ready and wait for Kapwing to process your video. <strong>All videos you create with the free version of this online video editor are going to be watermarked</strong> and you have to pay a six-dollar fee for each watermark-free video you edit with Kapwing or you can opt for a $20 monthly subscription fee that enables you to export an unlimited amount of videos without watermarks each month.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-convert-to-igtv.jpg"                      alt="Kapwing  Rotate YouTube video to IGTV"                ></p><p>A growing number of IGTV users choose to rotate their videos, instead of resizing them, so if you already have a YouTube video with a 16:9 aspect ratio you can just rotate it and get a video with a 9:16 aspect ratio. Click on the <strong>Rotate</strong>  option and then rotate it <strong>90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise</strong> and click on the <strong>Create button</strong>. If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > How to Convert MKV to MP4 without Losing Quality [Free Converters Provided] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro"></a>Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to <strong>set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. During the video editing process, you will have to <strong>resize all of the footage</strong> you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.</p><p>If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media.

Or, do you like to Livestream? These are two perks of having a YouTube account in good standing. You can lose these privileges, have your ability to post videos frozen, and even have your account terminated if you start accumulating strikes.</p><p>If you receive a strike, you will usually be able to get rid of it. This article will show you how.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><p><a href="#strikes">1. Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#wrong">2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#community">3. Community Guidelines Strikes</a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-strike.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Strike"                ></p><p> There are two types of strikes: <strong>Community Guideline Strikes</strong> and <strong>Copyright Strikes</strong>. Your account and all your videos will be deleted if you get three of either one of these types of strikes, but YouTube is fair about how these strikes are given out and how you can reverse them.</p><h2 id="1-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#1-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Copyright Strikes"></a>1. Copyright Strikes</h2><p>You get a copyright strike when you use media in your video which someone else owns the copyrights to. Music, clips, photographs, and sound effects are examples of the kinds of media you may use that could be owned by someone else.</p><p>The most obvious way to earn a copyright strike is to repost content which you did not create, i.e. clips from a television show or a popular song. If you know that the content you got a strike for was not yours and did not fall under <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >‘fair use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’, then there are two ways you can resolve it.</p><p>1. You can complete YouTube’s simple course on copyright infringement (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >Copyright School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and wait three months. Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides. The rights holder will have 10 business days to provide YouTube with evidence that they have initiated a court action against your content. There is a chance that they will not agree with you about the ‘fair use’ status of your video. You could be in for a bit of a fight.</p><p>If your account has been suspended for accumulating multiple strikes, you will no longer be able to access the online counter-notification form and will have to send a free-form counter-notification. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6005919" >Information on that can be found here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes"><a href="#3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community Guidelines Strikes"></a>3. Community Guidelines Strikes</h2><p>Most video creators – people who post vlogs, travel videos, and various kinds of tutorials – will never receive this type of strike. Sexual content, hateful content, threats, and scams are among the things you could post which would result in a community guidelines strike. Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks.

Be Real and Approachable"></a>1. Be Real and Approachable</h3><p>You should always be yourself when you vlog. People will subscribe when they feel invested in you as a person, and that happens when they feel like you are being sincere. You do not need to share all of your innermost secrets on your vlog, but you should let your viewers feel like they know you.</p><h3 id="2-Don’t-forget-to-add-a-call-to-action"><a href="#2-Don’t-forget-to-add-a-call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t forget to add a call to action"></a>2. Don’t forget to add a call to action</h3><p>Some people need to be prompted to subscribe to your channel, no matter how much they enjoy your content. At the end of all your videos, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and like your social media page.</p><p>Don’t forget to explain the benefits of subscribing to them, such as to benefit from your informative tips and gain a deeper insight into your projects. If you have any interesting videos in the pipeline, let them know about them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-video.JPG"                      alt="call to action"                ></p><h3 id="3-Listen-To-Your-Subscribers"><a href="#3-Listen-To-Your-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="3. Listen To Your Subscribers"></a>3. Listen To Your Subscribers</h3><p>It feels nice to get positive comments on your videos. If people feel comfortable enough to leave you suggestions and requests then that is even better. It means that you have succeeded in making them feel like they are part of your community.</p><p>If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions. If the majority of your subscribers enjoy your jokes and you get one comment telling you to stop trying to be funny then it is fairly obvious that that ‘suggestion’ does not really reflect the wishes of your community.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subscriber02.JPG"                      alt="get subscriber"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-your-title"><a href="#4-Optimize-your-title" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize your title"></a>4. Optimize your title</h3><p>Try not to underestimate the importance of a great eye-catching title. Include relevant words and phrases that you think people will search for and don’t just hastily add the first title that comes into your head. The better your title is, the more viewers and subscribers you are likely to amass.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-title.JPG"                      alt="title"                ></p><h3 id="5-Be-Patient"><a href="#5-Be-Patient" class="headerlink" title="5. Be Patient"></a>5. Be Patient</h3><p>Almost all vlogs grow slowly at first; the first 1000 subscribers take the longest to get. It takes a lot of patience to keep producing content on a regular schedule when it seems like not many people are watching, but you need to stick with it in order to grow.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-more-Subscribers-on-YouTube-for-Pros"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-more-Subscribers-on-YouTube-for-Pros" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Get more Subscribers on YouTube for Pros"></a>Part 2: How to Get more Subscribers on YouTube for Pros</h2><h3 id="1-Set-goals"><a href="#1-Set-goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Set goals"></a>1. Set goals</h3><p>You can gain extra drive and momentum by setting yourself attainable goals and encouraging your followers to help you achieve them. These goals can include milestones such as reaching 500 followers, 1,000 followers and so on. Don’t hesitate to tell your viewers about these goals – if they think your content is of real value, chances are they will be only too happy to assist you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-goals.JPG"                      alt="goals"                ></p><h3 id="2-Contests-can-be-funny-–-why-not-enter-one"><a href="#2-Contests-can-be-funny-–-why-not-enter-one" class="headerlink" title="2. Contests can be funny – why not enter one?"></a>2. Contests can be funny – why not enter one?</h3><p>One way to increase subscribers is to take part in a contest. A site called Gleam can oversee a contest for you. It’s up to you to choose how you want the contest to work, and you can gain an edge over your competitors by getting people to leave comments, follow you on Instagram, subscribe to your channel and more.</p><p>You will be provided with a landing page for promoting your channel, and you can share this in a variety of places, including on your Facebook, Twitter and blog. The best way to heighten your chances of success is to have a clear goal in mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-contest.JPG"                      alt="video0 contest"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-a-trailer"><a href="#3-Make-a-trailer" class="headerlink" title="3. Make a trailer"></a>3. Make a trailer</h3><p>YouTube’s channel interface allows you to add a <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3031012/9-short-storytelling-tips-from-a-master-of-movie-trailers" >trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to entice viewers into watching your videos and following you on the platform. Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.</p><p>Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become. And here are some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best trailer makers that you can use on both Windows and Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-killer-youtube-channel-trailer.jpg"                      alt="trailer"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It"></a>4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It</h3><p>You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.</p><p>Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.</p><h3 id="5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers"><a href="#5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers"></a>5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers</h3><p>Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.</p><p>Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cooperation.JPG"                      alt="cooperation"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]"></a>Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]</h2><p>There are lots of ways to get free YouTube subscribers. This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.</p><p>In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don’t need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.</p><h3 id="1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche"><a href="#1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche" class="headerlink" title="1. Find YouTubers in your niche"></a>1. Find YouTubers in your niche</h3><p>The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.</p><h3 id="2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like"><a href="#2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like" class="headerlink" title="2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like"></a>2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like</h3><p>Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.</p><p>It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel’s owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.</p><h3 id="3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day"><a href="#3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day" class="headerlink" title="3. Spend time watching videos each day"></a>3. Spend time watching videos each day</h3><p>Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.</p><p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p><h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return" class="headerlink" title="4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return"></a>4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p><p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p><h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p><p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p><h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again" class="headerlink" title="6. Do it all again. And again. And again"></a>6. Do it all again. And again. And again</h3><p>You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.</p><p>When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The following is a list of the <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>3 best YouTube name generators</strong></a>, an easy step-by-step for <strong>brainstorming</strong>, and instructions for updating your YouTube name.</p><p>Whether you’re a YouTuber beginner or want to improve your YouTube videos to the next level, a good <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be a good helper. Wondershare Filmora is a video editor for all YouTube creators with plentiful effects and templates, and you can download it directly and have a try before purchasing.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><hr><ol><li><a href="#generators">YouTube Name Generators</a></li><li><a href="#goodname">How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name</a></li><li><a href="#changename">How to Change Your YouTube Name</a></li><li><a href="#custom">Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-3-Awesome-YouTube-Name-Generators"><a href="#Part-1-3-Awesome-YouTube-Name-Generators" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 3 Awesome YouTube Name Generators"></a>Part 1: 3 Awesome YouTube Name Generators</h2><p>Need some help brainstorming your channel name? Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.spinxo.com/youtube-names/" >SpinXO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2. Name Generator"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="http://www.namegenerator.biz/youtube-name-generator.php" >Name Generator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can be hilarious</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Names tend to be a bit long</p><p>This is a fairly limited generator. You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3. Username Generator"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://namegenerators.org/username-generator/" >Username Generator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can generate a huge number of names at once</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  You only input one word</p><p>For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator"                ></p><p>The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it. Some endings are words, and some are just suffixes. Here’s what I got:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator-generated.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator Sample"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Come-Up-With-a-Good-YouTube-Name-–-3-Easy-Steps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Come-Up-With-a-Good-YouTube-Name-–-3-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps"></a>Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps</h2><p>The name of your YouTube channel needs to accomplish two things:</p><ol><li>Tell viewers what your channel is about</li><li>Stick in viewer’s heads by being catchy and unique</li></ol><p>Here’s how you can brainstorm the perfect name for your channel!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Gather-up-relevant-words"><a href="#Step-1-Gather-up-relevant-words" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Gather up relevant words"></a><strong>Step 1: Gather up relevant words</strong></h4><p>Open up a journal (or a word document) and start writing down words that relate to you and your channel.</p><p>You may want to make one list of ‘you’ words (personality traits, nicknames, titles, etc.) and another of words related to your channel’s category (i.e. gaming, makeup, or baking).</p><h4 id="Step-2-Combinations"><a href="#Step-2-Combinations" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Combinations"></a><strong>Step 2: Combinations</strong></h4><p>Start combining your ‘you’ words with your category words to see what sounds good. You may want to use one of the name generators above (anchor) for this part.</p><p>Try to keep your name fairly short (3 words or less) so it’s easier for people to remember. Don’t include numbers if you can avoid it.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Say-it-out-loud"><a href="#Step-3-Say-it-out-loud" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Say it out loud"></a><strong>Step 3: Say it out loud</strong></h4><p>Once you have a shortlist of potential names, read them aloud to yourself to make sure they sound good. Ideally, you want to get that ‘oh, that has a nice ring to it!’ feeling.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Your-YouTube-Name"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Your-YouTube-Name" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Your YouTube Name"></a>Part 3: How to Change Your YouTube Name</h2><p>In the early days of YouTube, you couldn’t change your name, but now you can!</p><ol><li>Click on your account icon in the top right corner of YouTube and choose settings.</li><li>Click <strong>Edit on Google</strong>.</li><li>Update your name and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Requesting-a-Custom-URL-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-Requesting-a-Custom-URL-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube"></a>Part 4: Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube</h2><p>Here are several <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of YouTube channel URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, wouldn’t it be nice if, instead of a string of numbers and letters, your channel URL included your name?

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram"></a>1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p><p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p><p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life" class="headerlink" title="2. Share Your Life"></a>2. Share Your Life</h4><p>Instagram allows you to consistently post content from your life. This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p><p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p><p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p><h3 id="How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed"><a href="#How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed" class="headerlink" title="How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed"></a>How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed</h3><p>When you post an image or a video onto Instagram directly it will be on your timeline and acts as a tile for your whole Instagram feed page. This piece of content will stay on your page forever, or until you delete it.</p><p>Like your YouTube videos, the content you post to your Instagram directly should have a cohesive theme that matches your branding. Keep an eye on your: -</p><p>- Aesthetic</p><p>- Caption</p><p>- Filter</p><p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself. Here are a few apps that you can include in your kit:</p><p>- <a href="https://vsco.co/"><strong>VSCO</strong></a>: A photo editor app that will allow you to clean up and enhance details to really make your visuals pop.</p><p>- <a href="https://unum.la/"><strong>UNUM</strong></a>: An Instagram planner app that enables you to visualize and pre-plan your post.</p><p>- <a href="https://later.com/"><strong>Later</strong></a>: A scheduling tool you can use to auto-publish to directly to Instagram.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.planoly.com/"><strong>Planoly</strong></a>: Drag and drop scheduler and planner, allows you to see the whole grid before posting.</p><p>Here’s Liza Koshy’s Instagram feed. As you can see, she has a clear style and also a variety of content. If you haven’t heard of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/lizakoshy/" >Liza Koshy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and found her through Instagram, you get curious: “What does she do?” Instagram is fantastic for building intrigue and garnering interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-liza-koshy.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample"                ><em>Instagram: Liza Koshy</em></p><p>This will be a good place to post a teaser of your latest video, upload an inspiring image, or share an interesting piece of content that shows the world what you are all about.</p><p>Have a different type of content lined up. You don’t want someone to end up on your Instagram page and only see selfies or inspiring quotes.</p><p>You won’t know which type of content will hook your next fan… so experiment.</p><p>When you post onto Instagram directly, you can’t add a are unable to link in the caption. This has been a bane for marketers and creators since the beginning of Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-2.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 2"                ></p><p><em>Instagram: Pointless Blog</em></p><p>While Instagram is a great engagement platform, it hasn’t been the best channel for those who want to have a direct call to action. The old method was to direct the viewer to your Instagram bio where there is the only place to post a link.</p><p>However, once you’ve gained a large following (10K) you will be able to <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-add-a-link-to-your-instagram-stories/" >attached links <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Instagram Story.</p><h3 id="2-How-YouTubers-Should-on-Post-Instagram-Story"><a href="#2-How-YouTubers-Should-on-Post-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="2.

Don’t want your Instagram Story to disappear forever?</h4><p>There is a feature called “Highlight” which archives your stories so that you can view them later, however, they will be kept on your Instagram profile page. This allows visitors to see your best stories and have prepared content even when you go 24 hours without posting something new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-3.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 3"                ><em>Instagram: Marianna Hewitt</em></p><h4 id="2-Use-Instagram-Story-to-Make-an-Announcement"><a href="#2-Use-Instagram-Story-to-Make-an-Announcement" class="headerlink" title="2.

Use Instagram Story to Make an Announcement</h4><p>While you are uploading your latest video to YouTube, go on Instagram Story and let your followers know.</p><p>Unlike posting directly to the Instagram timeline, once you reach a certain milestone, Instagram Story allows you to create a link right in the content. The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content. By doing so, you redirect them from Instagram to your YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-4.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 4"                ></p><p><em>Instagram: Jenn Im</em></p><p>Don’t think of Instagram Story as simply a mean for promoting your video, but a chance to give your loyal viewers an exclusive view into your process, allow them to get familiar with your personality and increase the exposure of your brand as a whole, solidifying your relationship.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Facebook is the world’s most popular social media platform. With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p><p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p><p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p><p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p><p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p><h4 id="1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook"><a href="#1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="1. Improve YouTube Video Thumbnail on Facebook"></a>1. Improve YouTube Video Thumbnail on Facebook</h4><p>Facebook doesn’t make it easy for YouTubers to show their video on Facebook’s news feed, especially if it is hosted on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="share YouTube video on Facebook"                ></p><p>When you post your video from YouTube directly to Facebook, it’ll look something like the image above. Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p><p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p><p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"                ></p><p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com. Yet, anyone viewing the video there is watching on YouTube, not Facebook. This allows you to still capture all the views, likes, and comments on YouTube.</p><h3 id="1-Managing-a-Facebook-Page-for-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#1-Managing-a-Facebook-Page-for-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1. Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel"></a>1. Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s. Hard truths: building a following from scratch is going to be a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard"><a href="#1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard" class="headerlink" title="1. Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p><p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p><h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin. If YouTube is your priority, all other social media communities should be complementary, not an obligation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Twitter-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-3-Twitter-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Twitter for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 3: Twitter for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Unlike Facebook or Instagram, Twitter is a platform where you must be ready with a large amount of valuable content to share, otherwise, you will be lost in the noise. Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p><p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p><h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags"></a>1. Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags</h4><p>In order to be successful on Twitter, you must be ready to jump onto a relevant trend. If you are talking about something that nobody is interested in, you might not be heard at all. Keep an eye on the most popular hashtags for that day and get involved with a conversation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-advantage-of-trending-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="take advantage of Twitter hashtag"                ></p><p>While you should definitely tweet and gain engagement for your YouTube videos, you will also need to tweet out other content.</p><p>Constantly keeping an eye on what the world is talking about gives you an idea of what is important to discuss. This may even help guide your next YouTube video.</p><h4 id="2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers"><a href="#2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="2. Tag Brands and Influencers"></a>2. Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit"></a>1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p><p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The chances of being discovered on Reddit is much higher than on Twitter, as the upvote&#x2F;downvote system gives your good work a higher platform to stand on while lowering the bad content to Reddit’s cellar.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand the Reddiquettes"></a>3. Understand the Reddiquettes</h4><p>When engaging on Reddit, you must abide by rules which are called “reddiquette.” There are global reddiquettes and then there are individual community reddiquette.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"><strong>Global reddiquettes</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p>- Search for duplicate content before posting.</p><p>- Consume the content before voting.</p><p>- Act as you would in real life.</p><p>- And more.</p><h4 id="3-Community-reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Community-reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community reddiquettes"></a>3. Community reddiquettes</h4><p>These are additional rules that the individual Reddit communities enforce. Be sure to read these rules before posting onto these specific communities. Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p><p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reddit-community-guideline-sample.jpg"                      alt="reddit community guideline sample"                ></p><p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p><p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p><h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely" class="headerlink" title="4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely"></a>4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p><p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

The videos start out a lot longer than you’ll want for an end screen (an end screen can’t last longer than 20 seconds), but you can shorten them by deleting all the ‘scenes’ you don’t need and keeping just the one or two you want.</p><p>The clips you can get from Biteable look great, and their process for changing the text and colors is simple and intuitive.</p><p>You can create 5 free projects every month with Biteable, but you’ll need to upgrade to their paid service to download them.

Your end screen will not add to the length of your video, it will overlay onto the last 5-20 seconds.</p><p>Here’s how you add an End Screen:</p><ol><li>Go to your <strong>YouTube Studio</strong>, then switch to <strong>Videos</strong> on the left menu;</li><li>Click <strong>Details</strong> next to the video you want to add an end screen to.</li><li>Click the <strong>End screen</strong> in the menu under the lower right window.</li><li>Click <strong>Element</strong> to start adding videos, playlists, and subscribe buttons to your outro. You could also choose to use the same layout as a previous end screen with <strong>Import From Video</strong>, or you could apply multiple elements at once with a <strong>YouTube Template</strong>.</li><li>Drag the elements to where you want them and adjust the timing using the timeline.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong> when you’re done.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-How-YouTube-Outros-End-Screens-Can-Help-You-Grow-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-How-YouTube-Outros-End-Screens-Can-Help-You-Grow-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How YouTube Outros&#x2F;End Screens Can Help You Grow on YouTube"></a>Part 4: How YouTube Outros&#x2F;End Screens Can Help You Grow on YouTube</h2><p>One of the most important statistics for measuring the growth of Your YouTube channel is Watch Time. You need 4,000 hours of watch time (over the past 12 months) in order to qualify for monetization&#x2F;the YouTube Partner Program, and watch time also plays an important role in how your videos are ranked in YouTube’s search results.</p><p>Watch time is more important than views. If you’re getting views, but people are only watching short sections of your video, YouTube’s algorithm thinks the people who are clicking on your videos don’t like them and ranks them lower.</p><p>Outros are one of the best ways of increasing the watch time for your channel, because the whole point of an outro is to convince viewers to stick around and watch more videos. Here are some best practices:</p><p><strong>Link to related videos and playlists</strong>: if someone has watched one video on a topic to the end, they’ll likely be interested in another highly related video from you. For example, someone who’s watched a Let’s Play for God of War is more likely to be interested in another God of War video than your review of your new gaming headset.</p><p><strong>Link to your newest video:</strong> YouTube’s algorithm places the most weight on the data it collects about your video within the first 24 hours of it being listed as Public. To give your newest video it’s the best chance at success, you should do everything you can to boost its watch time when it’s first posted and linking to it in the end screens of all your other videos is one way to do that.</p><p>You don’t have to change every screen individually, YouTube lets you link to your most recent video automatically.</p><p><strong>Link to Playlists:</strong> if you can get a viewer watching a playlist of related videos then that’s great for your watch time. If they’re already in a playlist they’re far more likely to watch multiple videos than if they have to go to your channel page and hunt down the content they’re interested in.</p><p><strong>Include a ‘CTA’ with your subscribe button:</strong> besides just including a button people can use to subscribe, you should ask them to click on it with a ‘Call to Action’ or CTA. This can mean writing something like ‘Subscribe for more videos!’ on your end card, or asking them in an outro voiceover. People are more likely to subscribe if you ask than if you don’t.</p><p>Are you using a YouTube outro? What elements do you include, and how do you think it’s helped the growth of your channel?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-screen-saga-a-thousand-stories-one-channel-at-a-time/"><u>2024 Approved  Screen Saga  A Thousand Stories, One Channel at a Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-managing-a-day-job-and-your-thriving-youtube-channel/"><u>2024 Approved  Managing a Day Job and Your Thriving YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-exclusive-guide-to-the-best-7-android-browsers-ad-free/"><u>In 2024, Exclusive Guide to the Best 7 Android Browsers, Ad-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplifying-complexities-in-youtube-shorts/"><u>In 2024, Simplifying Complexities in YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-fun-frenzy-youtube-writers-of-joyful-entertainment/"><u>2024 Approved  Fun Frenzy  YouTube’ Writers of Joyful Entertainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-rapidly-eliminating-youtube-feedback/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Rapidly Eliminating YouTube Feedback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-explore-the-world-of-frames-5-free-youtube-tips-for-you/"><u>2024 Approved  Explore the World of Frames  5 Free YouTube Tips for You</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-inspiring-ideas-gratis-graphics-for-your-channel/"><u>In 2024, Inspiring Ideas  Gratis Graphics for Your Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-most-wallet-friendly-cloud-haven-for-mass-datasets-for-2024/"><u>The Most Wallet-Friendly Cloud Haven for Mass Datasets for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/experience-the-future-of-mobile-gaming-iphone-vr-leaderboard-for-2024/"><u>Experience the Future of Mobile Gaming  IPhone VR Leaderboard for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/solved-how-to-transfer-from-apple-iphone-se-2022-to-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>Solved How To Transfer From Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essential-guide-to-creating-cinematic-videos-in-camtasa/"><u>In 2024, The Essential Guide to Creating Cinematic Videos in Camtasa</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/revolutionary-tiktok-profits-estimator-guide/"><u>Revolutionary TikTok Profits Estimator Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/1716465606196-enjoy-premium-video-artwork-download-at-no-cost-today/"><u>Enjoy Premium Video Artwork - Download at No Cost Today!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-rhythm-without-the-ruckus-zero-cost-digital-volume-reduction-for-karaoke-maestros/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Rhythm Without the Ruckus Zero-Cost, Digital Volume Reduction for Karaoke Maestros.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-crafting-impact-best-9-video-thumbnail-makers-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Crafting Impact  Best 9 Video Thumbnail Makers Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-stardew-ginger-island-playbook/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Stardew Ginger Island Playbook</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

When you’re stuck, the best thing to do can be to keep your ideas simple. Focus on being engaging instead of on coming up with an original idea nobody’s ever tried – your video will be original because you’re the one doing it and you’re unique.</p><p>They say that less is more, so let’s have a look at how you can apply this principle to practice and create amazing YouTube videos from small ideas.</p><ol><li><a href="#one">Introduce Yourself</a></li><li><a href="#two">Vlog About Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#three">Express an Opinion</a></li><li><a href="#four">Review Anything</a></li><li><a href="#five">Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc.</a></li><li><a href="#six">What’s on Your Phone?</a></li><li><a href="#seven">Make a Slideshow</a></li><li><a href="#eight">Make a Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#nine">10 Things About You</a></li><li><a href="#ten">Video Rant</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-Introduce-Yourself"><a href="#1-Introduce-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduce Yourself"></a>1. Introduce Yourself</h2><p>Let the world know who you are and what you do. If you are planning on starting a YouTube channel, or if you’ve already been posting videos on a topic but haven’t formally introduced yourself, it’s a great idea to put some thought into an introduction video. Producing such a YouTube video will enable you to introduce yourself to your future subscribers and give them an idea as to what your channel is all about.</p><p>These kinds of videos make great channel trailers, and they’re a good way to highlight the topics you’ll be covering on your channel in the future.</p><h2 id="2-Vlog-About-Your-Day"><a href="#2-Vlog-About-Your-Day" class="headerlink" title="2. Vlog About Your Day"></a>2. Vlog About Your Day</h2><p>Anything that happens during your day can become a topic for your YouTube vlog. Traffic jams, treacherous pets who keep stealing your shoes, or the ridiculous amount of things you had to do in a single day can all become topics for videos you upload to your YouTube channel. Being candid and spontaneous is a sure way to grab the attention of a viewer, but limiting the duration of a vlog to a few minutes is key to ensuring that viewers watch the video until the end.</p><p>Strive to make visually dynamic videos, because just sitting or standing and talking in front of a camera for a few minutes isn’t going to create much on-screen action.</p><h2 id="3-Express-An-Opinion"><a href="#3-Express-An-Opinion" class="headerlink" title="3. Express An Opinion"></a>3. Express An Opinion</h2><p>Social media culture has enabled us to receive news instantly and react to it in any way we want. If you didn’t like the latest update of your favorite video game, or if you’re excited about a line of makeup that’s coming out soon, make a video about it and share your opinion with the community that follows you on YouTube.</p><p>Opinion videos are great conversation starters. Expressing an opinion through a YouTube video can get you a lot of comments and even inspire others to take action.</p><p>You can express your opinions on virtually any topic, but being respectful while doing so is for the best if you don’t want to find yourself in a YouTube feud.</p><h2 id="4-Review-Anything"><a href="#4-Review-Anything" class="headerlink" title="4. Review Anything"></a>4. Review Anything</h2><p>Everywhere around you, there are items you can review. The Apple Watch and the latest season of Game of Thrones are equally good choices for a review video. However, when creating review videos you need to make sure that all the factual information you have is accurate, which is why it is much better to make review videos about topics you know a lot about.</p><p>Review videos can also be a source of revenue because a lot of companies sponsor YouTubers who review their products.</p><h2 id="5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc"><a href="#5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc" class="headerlink" title="5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc"></a>5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc</h2><p>Are you a Tarantino fan? Why not? When you are struggling to find inspiration for your videos, just think about the things you like. Your subscribers are interested in you, so they’ll be interested in knowing about your favorite movies or music albums. Books, movies, and music are an inexhaustible source of fresh ideas because there is always a new song or a film you can talk about in your video.</p><p>You can do a ‘my 5 favorite songs’ type of video, or talk in detail about just one favorite.</p><h2 id="6-What’s-on-Your-Phone"><a href="#6-What’s-on-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="6. What’s on Your Phone?"></a>6. What’s on Your Phone?</h2><p>There were over two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2017, and this number is only going to continue rising in the next couple of years. Furthermore, thousands of YouTubers are already producing unimaginable amounts of videos about the latest apps or smartphone devices.</p><p>Finding a way to talk about the apps you like to use the most can be a good idea if you want to attract more visitors to your YouTube channel. However, you need to be clear about whether this is a lifestyle or vlog-style video covering a topic that usually exists in the tech genre, or if you are a tech YouTuber, so as not to confuse your audience (you don’t want people to start expecting app reviews if that’s not what you usually do).</p><h2 id="7-Make-a-Slideshow"><a href="#7-Make-a-Slideshow" class="headerlink" title="7. Make a Slideshow"></a>7. Make a Slideshow</h2><p>There’s no need to constantly produce new videos because you can just take some royalty-free music and create a slideshow from your old or new photos. The slideshow format will certainly allow you to try something different on your YouTube channel, while the photos you use in the slideshow can create a clear picture of who you are and what you do for your viewers.</p><p>If you are a photography enthusiast you can also plan the entire slideshow in advance and then make a short video about how you created the images in the slideshow.</p><h2 id="8-Make-a-Tutorial"><a href="#8-Make-a-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="8. Make a Tutorial"></a>8. Make a Tutorial</h2><p>Education is our only hope for a better world so if you know how to do something well, don’t be afraid to share your knowledge. A tutorial is a powerful educational tool that enables you to guide people through the entire process of making origami, solving a complicated video editing problem, maintaining a motorcycle, or anything else.</p><p>YouTube channels that feature tutorials often have millions of followers, because YouTube is a popular place to go when you need information.</p><h2 id="9-10-Things-About-You"><a href="#9-10-Things-About-You" class="headerlink" title="9. 10 Things About You"></a>9. 10 Things About You</h2><p>Being open is important, so why not share 10 things about yourself you think your audience would find interesting or which you think are important for people to know. The top 10 things structure is often used in YouTube videos because it provides a clear rhythm to a video clip, and it enables you to gradually increase the tension as the video progresses.</p><p>These types of videos tend to create a better relationship with your audience because they make the viewer feel as if they know the person on the screen.</p><h2 id="10-Video-Rant"><a href="#10-Video-Rant" class="headerlink" title="10. Video Rant"></a>10. Video Rant</h2><p>Doing things when you are angry is usually a bad idea, but if you feel so strongly about a particular subject then creating a video rant can be a great idea. Rants don’t even have to be angry, they can be about something that puzzles you or something so great you just can’t get over it. These kinds of videos can get your YouTube channel a lot of comments, likes, and subscribers.</p><p>Don’t try to fake a rant, because they only work if they are natural. Scripting a video rant may be an interesting creative task, but genuine reactions are always more effective.
